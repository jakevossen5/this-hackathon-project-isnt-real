Another challenge was shortage of authorized and known parking spaces leading to traffic chaos specially in peak times and seasons, more so as the city scales up. Inspired by digital India initiatives including smart city, and a strong desire to solve this major problem, along with an effort to bring about parking discipline culture in the city led to this innovative solution.  
 Over 300+ customers have requested an onpremises add-on from Lucidchart. We built this for them, and for all the others who wanted Lucidchart, but were unable to adopt our cloud-based solution.Why it's specialWhile we were not able to replicate all of web-based Lucidchart's functionality (e.g., mobile apps, @mentioning, free integrations, etc.), we still wanted to deliver the premier self-hosted solution for Confluence. Below are a few features that only we are able to offer to customers behind firewalls.Real-time collaboration - multiple editors can diagram together in real-time without overriding each other's edits, enhancing collaboration. Lucidchart OnPrem is the first self-hosted add-on with real-time collaborationIn-editor collaboration - comment on shapes, leave feedback, and record next steps within the diagramPresentation-mode - easily create presentations from diagrams for meetings, or embed as slides in pagesVisio import / export - high-fidelity Visio import and exportAuto-generate diagrams - automatically generate ERDs and other diagrams from source files, like .schemaAll of these features come in addition to the standard functionality of creating, editing, and embedding diagrams, charts, and visuals to improve communication in Confluence. Lucidchart also includes extensive templates and shape libraries for network diagrams, flowcharts, UML diagrams, UI mockups, Venn diagrams, org charts and more. How we built itWe reimplemented some of the back end code of our cloud app within the Confluence environment and tweaked the front end to work with it. In the process we had to make significant changes to core system concepts like users, collaboration, comments, diagrams, and attachments so that they make sense on this new platform. Since this add-on has to work on instances without any internet access, we had to bundle all the necessary resources (js, css, images, fonts, templates, etc.) inside the add-on instead of loading them on-demand from a CDN. Implementing some of our unique features like real-time collaboration was particularly challenging as this is not a feature implemented for Server-based add-ons, and the approach was new to the add-on ecosystem.Challenges we ran intoWe ran into several major challenges in taking the functionality of our add-on from the cloud to fully onpremises. Among these were challenges enabling real-time collaboration, using an embedded rich viewer within Confluence to create slide shows, and taking our 100% cloud-based functionality into a format that can be used entirely behind a firewall.What's next for Lucidchart OnPrem for Confluence ServerWe are currently taking the lessons we learned from building Lucidchart OnPrem and applying them to our web-based Lucidchart add-on. These changes will make both products faster, more reliable, and more valuable to our end users. Aside from the business push, we also plan to continue iterating and improving upon the add-on based on customer feedback. For instance, we will be releasing a new version with improved revision history controls shortly.SummaryJust like taking a Server-based add-on to the Cloud, taking Lucidchart to the Server was challenging and required many large and small changes to our existing product to deliver an excellent solution for our customers. We hope you'll enjoy testing Lucidchart OnPrem. Feel free to give us your thoughts as we are always working to make our products better, faster, and smarter.

 taxi problems in Morroco 
 While on my trip to a hilly terrain region in remote parts of India, I faced a lot of difficulties to drive through the region, which had challenges like muddy slippery road, lack of street lights and U shaped curves. This was a common problem among tourist and goods travelers in this region frequently, which increased the maintenance cost of their vehicle. I took this as an opportunity to resolve this problem, which gave rise to Maasto-101

 Previously, we (team behind StepShot) developed a plug-in, StepShot Step-by-Step Guides Creator, to automate the creation process for IT documentation; however, it was a little complicated to use for quick and simple tasks, such as taking a screenshot and adding some instructions on top of it. That’s why we decided to simplify the work process of thousands of IT professionals by creating StepShot Image Editor, which has all the necessary functions to annotate the images.  
 In Morocco, cabs are allowed to have multiple stops to pick up a maximum of three passengers. Therefore, a taxi driver who already has a passenger aboard is constrained to only pick up other passengers _ going the same way_. Eventually, before getting into the cab, the passenger has to ask the driver if they are both going the same direction, which can be  exhausting for both passengers and taxi drivers. In mid-August, my teammate and I came across the Code4Cabs Challenge and found it a great opportunity to contribute to enhancing the taxi-driver/passenger experience in Morocco. In fact, before starting the development of the project, Ali and I have conducted a survey where we have asked more than 120 taxi drivers from Rabat and Casablanca about their preferences about applications they may need. This experience was very enriching as it allowed us to study the real need of taxi drivers which inspired us to come up with ChedliTaxi. According to our survey audience, here is the taxi-driver's wish list:I do not want to stop if the client is not getting into the cab.I need a way to know the client's destination before stopping.I do not want to be stopped by two people when I have only one free seat.I need a service that will tell me where the nearest next potential clients are.I do not want to make detours to reach to clients and find out they are going to a different locations. Unfortunately, all the applications available to users and taxi-drivers are based solely Google Maps and Geocoding APIs, which do not give precise information in Morocco (wrong direction, nonexistent streets.) Worse, although these services can be very efficient when used in developed countries, using them in Morocco just makes the driver's wish list longer.Our idea is to make use of the most powerful CPU in the business, the driver's brain, to judge whether a client is worth picking or not. In fact, the process was mainly inspired from the wish list above; ChedliTaxi lets you send a request with a vocal message to drivers that are on the same street as you, or at most 300 meters away from you. What ChedliTaxi doesThe application comes in a passenger version and a taxi driver one. The typical Chedli Taxi workflow is as follows:The application set the departure point to the current location of the clientThe client records a Voice Message about the destination and chooses the number of seats needed (1 to 3)The application's algorithm takes care of broadcasting the request to only cabs who are in the same street as the client, or those who are at most 300 meters away.The drivers receive the request, see the client position on the map and the number of seats, listen to the voice message, judge the route (as if they were stopped, but without wasting time) then either Accept or Decline the request.The client can track drivers on the mapThe client can choose to send a new request, in which case, the previous request expiresChallenges we ran intoAs we only found out about the project one month and a half ago, developing ChedliTaxi was not a straightforward job. As you may know, proper Android development takes time especially when dealing with a Real-Time communication application (synchronization of tasks...).In fact, we have received many returns with nonexistent streets and wrong directions that made the Exception Handling process very tiring. Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe are glad that the application made it through almost all the tests, from sending the request until having it accepted by a driver. The minimal bugs reported during the testing phase are to be fixed and patched in ChedliTaxi V2.What's next for ChedliTaxiActually, clients will fall in love with ChedliTaxi if there is a big number of drivers using it as well. The client would ideally use the application to find available taxis instantly. Therefore, the next phase is application marketing; we need to have as many drivers and clients using the application. Concerning the future of the application development, as mentioned previously, we will be accordingly releasing patches to bugs discovered by users.Built Withandroidandroid-studiogoogle-mapsjavamysqlphp      Submitted to    Ford Code for Taxicabs Mobility ChallengeWinner                Third Prize              Winner                Popular Choice                  Created by  I took care of coding the application after my teammate and I have made the software design together.

 In the current media landscape, control over distribution has become almost as important as the actual creation of content, and that has given Facebook a huge amount of power. The impact that Facebook newsfeed has in the formation of opinions in the real world is so huge that it potentially affected the 2016 election decisions, however these newsfeed were not completely accurate. Our solution? FiB because  With 1.5 Billion Users, Every Single Tweak in an Algorithm Can Make a Change, and we dont stop at just one. 
  
  
 Ever happened to you, that you urgently left for somewhere and reached even more late because of the road traffics, diversions, constructions, obstructions,etc ?This is exactly what inspired us to make TrafFeed. Because technically, its far better to know about the delay beforehand and save the time to be wasted by a bit than to reach by the end of the ceremony. And keeping in mind the safety of people driving on roads, the app also promotes awareness posts and notices. 
  
 Our inspiration was to create a product that revolutionizes how Agile and traditional organizations manage releases and programs. We wanted to provide rich functionality for Program, Project and Release managers and teams that will allow them to design and use any processes that control the execution of their initiatives, similar to what JIRA provides for individual issues. 
 Ever happened to you that on red signal you are behind stop line but many people are on the stop or on pedestrian crossing making it difficult for people to cross road. Or on no-parking area people are parking their vehicles making it difficult for others to drive in that area. It makes me thinking can we this dump traffic cctv camera's, speakers smarter & with that born a smart near real time video analysis solution Traffico.  
 Working in an international team involves working in multiple time zones.As a result, there are tons of emails of JIRA issue updates in the Inbox every morning.The plug-in is designed to reduce the read time of these JIRA notifications by intelligently grouping JIRA issue updates and sending them as a digest at a scheduled time per user. 
 Ever happened to you, that you urgently left for somewhere and rather, reached late because of the road traffics, obstructions, etc? This is exactly what inspired us to make this App because technically, it’s far better to know about the delay beforehand and save the time. Before leaving we can search for real time traffic, traffic signals, shortest route availability, and Road bumps without getting stuck in traffic and for safety we have all numbers and shortest path in it for safe driving. As we know Indore is in top 4 commercial cities, by conducting this contest, FORD encouraged us for developing an App which can increase awareness towards public transport and help in preventing road accidents. An initiative called Drive Safe to prevent road accidents was launched in the city.  Shri P. Narahari District Collector, Indore and Mr. Sandeep Soni Joint Collector & CEO Atal Indore City Transport Services Ltd (AICTSL) Indore and public transport administration, are working on the issue.They inspired us to provide a Safety platform which can contribute in their campaign and help in preventing Accidents.

 In a sense, social media has democratized news media itself -- through it, we have all become "news editors" to some degree, shaping what our friends read through our shares, likes, and comments. Is it any wonder, then, that "fake news" has become such a widespread problem? In such partisan times, it is easy to find ourselves ourselves siloed off within ideological echo chambers. After all, we are held in thrall not only by our cognitive biases to seek out confirmatory information, but also by the social media algorithms trained to feed such biases for the sake of greater ad revenue. Most worryingly, these ideological silos can serve as breeding grounds for fake news, as stories designed to mislead their audience are circulated within the target political community, building outrage and exacerbating ignorance with each new share. We believe that the problem of fake news is intimately related to the problem of the ideological echo chambers we find ourselves inhabiting. As such, we designed "Open Mind" to attack these two problems at their root.

 Our technology firm Kickdrum has been working with hybrid onshore and offshore teams for many years. Our people are distributed geographically and across many time zones, working on very large software projects around the clock. Most of the work is done by people that are not in the room with us - people who are awake when we are sleeping. This gap makes it critical to communicate vision, requirements, status and bugs as clearly as possible, or else we’re stuck having to wait until tomorrow to try again.We set out to design something that is a game-changer for remote team communication.  We needed HYFY to be as powerful as video conferencing but not require everyone to be online at the same time.  Our goal is to make HYFY the simplest way to record your screen & voice and share instantly so the team just “gets it.” With a single click, you can narrate a video story of your work and share it immediately wherever your team works.  In our case, that's JIRA and HipChat. 
 While many tools exists to facilitate planned remote meetings, distributed teammates tend to get left out of ad hoc or impromptu meetings.These informal meetings often generate important decisions, but it’s hard to make sure all relevant teammates are included. By the time you determine if your remote teammate is available and get them on the phone, the conversation could already be over — and you risk taking teammates out of the zone with the interruption.Even worse, if you don’t document what was discussed, you risk losing the insight gained from the conversation.

 While working with one of our customers we realized several manufacturing facilities lack a comprehensive indoor tracking, automation and control system. Most of the available solutions are GPS based, which is not a viable technology indoors.

 From the touching scenes of seeing a beggar fill his bottle with dirty water from a roadside pit to women queuing and fighting every morning to fill their pots with water for their families, our inspiration primarily comes from these harsh realities of life that we have seen in front of our eyes. Despite being a basic human right, access of clean water isn't available to many. Yet, more often, we city dwelling folks take this blessing for granted. Also, water crisis is a global phenomena. The problem is so interconnected that it cannot be addressed on an individual or national level. In California, while it is understood that agriculture remains one of the major users of water, putting substantial pressure on this sector to reduce its water usage can create a ripple effect on the economy through increased food prices and unemployment. It is these realisations that led us to devise a solution for Urban Water management that holds the city dwelling folks accountable for their actions and is easily scalable globally. The solution aspires to use the power of technology to manage not just California’s but the world's water crisis problem and remind everyone that Water is a precious resource that needs to be used wisely. 
 Although there are so many documentation tools nowadays, the problem that documentation is expected to be an exceptional boredom still exists. The idea is to make software process documentation within enterprises as simple as possible.

 One of the team members grandfathers went blind after slipping and hitting his spinal cord, going from a completely independent individual to reliant on others for everything. The lack of options was upsetting, how could a man who was so independent be so severely limited by a small accident. The technology to solve these problems exist but a lack of engineering effort means no options exist in today's market. We hope to help our team member's grandfather and others like him regain his independence by making a tool that is affordable, efficient, and liberating.  
 In Africa, where I come from, internet access is a very big deal. Internet access costs an average of about 1$ for just 10MB, so, it's only for very important reasons you want to use it. Affording a couple of dollars might even be spared at times but buying a smart phone or a laptop is more expensive, all because you want to access your email. A cyber cafe would have even been a cheaper alternative to access your email, but cyber security is the greatest challenge in this case. Remote Access Trojans (RATs), keyloggers and other spyware make cyber cafes dangerous to use, to access your email.As a Microsoft Office Specialist Master, a software developer and a security certified expert, I decided to develop a solution that will help users access their emails offline using a simple phone call or SMS (Short Message Service) from a verified phone number. New emails come in as phone calls and SMS (Short Message Service) as well. This solution not only provides offline access to emails alone but also to files and calendar events. 
 The main inspiration behind this idea is "Most of the organisations avoid using PDF related automation because of OCR & its accuracy, and they miss to utilize wonderful functionality of UiPath which can extract the data with 100% accuracy from Native PDFs, with this snippet they will be able to segregate the PDFs based on its type(Native or Scanned)." 
  
 We live in a world where every year millions of people are migrating. In 2018, 240 million people migrated to other countries and 20% of them were displaced. We want to create a tool to facilitate immigrants start over again. 
 Basically, when faced with the challenge of coming up with a final year project as requirement to fulfillment of my BSc pursuit in Systems Engineering, I had no idea what kind of project i can work on, so i made some research and did some findings where I discovered that in some rural and under-developed areas in the world today, during malaria diagnosis by a skilled and experienced lab scientist, manual counting of presence of malaria parasite in a cell is still done just to verify if a patient is infected with malaria or not.

 Games with split screen multiplayer are currently few and far between especially on mobile and we wanted to bring that experience back  , so we built Touch Wizards a game where you can grap your pal and challenge him into a wizard duel 
 We start from the principle that business wants to turn the platform in an auto-sustainable system to attract both influencers and brands automatically.We also had a vision that MuseFind wants to keep a closer contact/relation with their customers.With this terms we designed a new website that can clearly pass a message to  influencer and brand they can achieve their goals conecting to each other through the platform. 
 On a normal working day, we were a team of 4-5 people sitting together and had built a website earlier. We were not at all active in checking whether the website is used by ANYONE at all. So we started using Google Analytics for the same. Days passed by, and we were just too lazy to open up the google analytics dashboard everyday and check. Luckily, we had Alexa with us and we wanted something easier for us. Why not just ask Alexa about it? 
  
 Being a streamer and developer I'm always running out of time to do things, so when a viewer sends me a gift or package to my POBOX, I want to make sure the package is there. Sometimes when I would get to the post office to pick up the package there was a delay and I ended up having to go back in a day or two. Or worse yet showing up and it's not there and I have to try and get a tracking number from the person who sent it!  
 Montreal, the so-called Paris of North America, is one of the main touristic attractions in Canada.  With around 10 million tourists visiting Montreal and a population of 4 million, it is easy to see why parking is becoming a greater challenge more than ever before. Therefore, we have created an app that makes the understanding of multiple parking panels easy. 
 The inspiration for this application came from the lack of applications which can create and organize small-scale social events. There are many applications for mobile devices which allow users to create large-scale events with high expected populations. LITT is the perfect solution for events of all sizes and formalities. We were also interested in making an application which is like social media, but at the same time does not involve only device-to-device interaction. Thus the name: "Life and Interaction Through Technology". With LITT, users are able to use technology to experience the natural joy and enjoyment of real-life interaction. 
 From the times we had to help a visually impaired person on the street where we wish we could have done more. From the realization that having to perform and function in a foreign space is anxiety inducing enough as able bodied people. The thought of facing this challenge as someone with a visual impairment seems next to impossible without guidance.  
 It’s an exciting time for innovations in ed tech, and chatbots are at the forefront.Chatbots allow for the automation of repetitive and time-consuming communication while freeing up more time for meaningful discussions and interactions between professors and students. Should professors be wasting time answering questions such as “When is the paper due?” or replying to emails such as “When are your office hours?”. Instead they could be engaged in something more productive such as analysis of the material they reviewed in class. Chatbots can also help them conduct realtime poll in the classroom. Apart from these, the idea of personal attention for each and every student (something we plan to work on in near future) is another main motivation for this project. Check out this video for more inspiration:   
  
 With the legalization of cannabis recently in Canada and the ever-lasting threat of people endangering lives while driving under the influence, we wanted to make an accurate, easy-to-use, yet powerful tool to detect sobriety in individuals. This could be used as a tool to prevent your friends from driving under the influence, by law enforcement to detect inebriated people or companies looking to make sure their employees are sober before operating heavy machinerie.

 628,521… was the total amount of reported criminal attacks against students on their way to and from school in the US elementary, secondary & universities campuses on 2014. From this amount, around 40 were murders and almost 170,000 were classified as serious violent victimizations such as rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault [1]. We see these numbers more than a mere statistics but lives that were marked because of an unfortunate event.Also, between 2001 and 2013 on average 4% of students reported being afraid of an attack or harm on the way to and from school. This makes at least 2 million students in the U.S. (plus their parents) likely to be interested in using the application [1].So, how to improve our youngest’ safety? How to help them decide which is the safest path to their destination? Or even better, how to watch their steps remotely?We are living in a dynamic world in which everything is evolving at a very fast pace, even the way crimes are committed. We believe that people’s collaboration can make powerful contributions. Detroiters are already turning this belief into action by releasing the Detroit Strategic Framework Plan which is “a guiding blueprint for transforming Detroit from its current state of population loss and excessive vacancy into a model for the reinvention of post-industrial American cities” (Griffin, Cramer, & Powers, 2014) [2]. So the purpose is to design a community-based & crowdmapping application to enhance public safety by connecting you to a relative or friend by sharing your route so they keep an eye on you. As the security threats expert Marc Goodman puts it: “After all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals”.Why is this app relevant to Detroit’s needs?Although this is an application for any pedestrian and/or driver located in any city, we identified the following reasons for which Detroit, initially, will be interested in this solution:Public safety is frequently addressed across the imperatives on the Detroit Strategic Framework Plan as evidence of citizen’s priority [3].At the Wayne State University & Wayne County Community College District campuses alone, an average of 87 criminal offenses per year were reported during 2012-2014 [4].There were more than 530 carjacking offenses, 2,600 street robberies and 9,100 aggravated assaults reported in Detroit on 2015 [5].There were 54,483 people involved in 22,833 crashes within Detroit in 2015 [6].Enables citizens to commute anytime and anywhere feeling safer, thus, increase economic growth, as “public safety plays a critical role in supporting economic growth and vitality by reducing the cost of crime and enhancing the desirability of communities as places to live and locate businesses”(Keeling & Cleverley, 2012) [7].Increase continuous improvement by creating a feedback loop empowering citizens participation by monitoring safety concerns within their neighborhood public areas.High people density with tech devices making them target to crimes.What it DoesMarauder mApp enhance security throughout your route (walking, public transport or car) by connecting you to a relative or friend by sharing your route so they can watch your real-time path remotely. It also enables you to foresee any security alerts, street lights that are not working or hazards raised by other active users. Thanks to this you will be able to find the best path with the least dangers.The application displays an emergency button to call 911 and it also features a panic mode which alerts your virtual watcher if you are in trouble (New feature). This panic mode is triggered automatically if you suddenly drop your mobile and/or run or while driving if a car door is opened or the airbags deployed (This feature is not included on the Demo yet). When triggered it will begin a countdown of 5 seconds allowing you to dismiss the alert in case of a false alarm. When driving the alert can be dismissed by a voice command (This feature is not included on the Demo yet). We envision the application to be compatible with smart cities initiatives, such as street lights that are equipped with motion sensors and cameras. This way Marauder mApp can give life to your route by enabling you and your virtual companion to watch your path in advance with real-time activity and pictures streamed from outdoor street lights --- this real-time data version is available on the demo.While driving, Marauder mApp provides traffic data along your route (New feature). This uses the GE Current street light data which provides traffic information such as the amount of cars in your route and the lanes used.What makes this possible?Although Marauder mApp can be implemented with smartphone technology alone, its experience can be enhanced by leveraging car hardware modules (e.g. OpenXC) and city infrastructure such as public lighting technology (e.g. GE Current motion sensors and cameras).The video streaming, pedestrian and traffic information rely on the GE Predix platform and its usage of GE Current street lights. The use of Predix and the GE Current street lights are not the only options to gather this information. Any cameras and other type of sensors with internet capabilities can be integrated with Marauder mApp. For example, the cameras installed on highways by the State of Michigan could be hooked up to provide video (http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/drive).The panic mode feature can be enabled with current smartphone technology. Sudden motions such as the phone falling or a user running can be detected both in iOS and Android devices. The panic mode for the vehicle users can be implemented using the OpenXC platform. Marauder mApp can be connected to the car ODB-II port via Bluetooth allowing the application to extract information from the vehicle such as the doors, airbag status and vehicle emergency codes.MVP Testing Instructions & FeaturesGo to http://godetroit.iamweb.com:3000/Create an account --- you can use fake e-mail if preferred, test@user.com works.Click on "Create Route’.Input "365-399 Broadway, San Diego, CA 92101, USA" in the From text box [a].Input "1402 K Street, San Diego, CA 92101, USA" in the To textbox [a].Let the Marauder mApp know if your are walking or driving.Click on "Get Route".MVP Demo ExplanationA map will show up displaying the recommended route. The traced path indicates the three GE Current streetlights available as dots. Every time there is activity within the LED sensor’s range a location marker will pop-up. If you roll your mouse over any of these markers, the total count of people in the area will pop-up.At the bottom of the screen, images streamed from the recommended route’s outdoor streetlights will be displayed. Share your route by clicking on "Share".If clicked on your cell phone will send the route link to any friend on Whatsapp [b].If clicked on a desktop browser, the share button will copy the route’s URL to the clipboard to be shared as needed.You can click the emergency button which will display the alert message your watcher would see.Additionally, there is a yellow “Panic Demo!” button. Clicking it will trigger panic mode and will display a dialog with a countdown.If the countdown goes down to zero an alert message that would be shown to your watcher will appear.You can click the “I’m okay” button which will stop the countdown and bring you back to your route.You can click the “I need help!” button which will display the alert message.Note a: This is the only route that works on this MVP as the LED sensors are narrowed down to this area.Note b: Whatsapp is supported as an example. Other messaging applications such as SMS, iMessage or Facebook Messenger can be added.What’s New on Marauder mApp goDetroitShare and watch routes not only walking but on car as well.Notify your virtual companion once you have arrived.New panic mode triggered by running, airbag deployment and other events.New 911 emergency button.Gather traffic data from the Predix platform.What’s Next for Marauder mAppCommunicate street light sensors to coordinate traffic lights for a rapid traffic flow.Trigger the panic mode if the user runs and/or drops the mobile.Leverage OpenXC while driving to trigger the panic mode by monitoring the user’s vehicle: Panic mode starts if the vehicle doors are opened or the airbags are deployed.Add a new “I’m nervous” button.  When clicked the user needs to keep it pressed. If the finger is removed trigger the panic mode.Enable active users to share real-time security alerts, street lights that are not working, accidents, and other hazards.Enable virtual companion to recommend pedestrian to change route.Filter streamed camera images by selecting streetlight on the map.Position the pedestrian being watched on the map. (Currently can be done but for demonstration purposes, since there are only 3 sensors in San Diego).How was the Project built?Marauder mApp is built on Javascript with Node.js, MongoDB and the Meteor Framework. This is used to create a lightweight web application that can be executed either on desktop or mobile and that can display information on real time.To display the information the GE Predix platform is used. The project consumes four Predix microservices: User Account and Authentication, Pedestrian Planning, Public Safety and Traffic Planning. GE’s Intelligent Environment Public Safety API service provides real-time and historical images/video from each intelligent LED light installed in a city.Accomplishments we are proud ofThe project is able to trace routes that contain the GE Current streetlights and Cameras as way-points so that the route you take can be watched. The real time sharing of information is really powerful because the pedestrian does not need to have the phone on the hand, and suspicious activity is noted by the watcher, a message or a phone call will make them change the route.Projected Use-CaseAlice wants to go from the University to her house late at night after a long study session. She pulls her mobile, opens Marauder mApp and enters her destination, she then decides to send a request to her friend Bob so that he can keep an eye on her journey home.While Bob makes himself a sandwich, he gets a few pictures of Alice getting outside of the University from his home computer. Dinner in hand, he checks some images from a couple of blocks ahead of Alice. Seen everything looks fine he goes back to his dinner and starts reading a book.Every few blocks the application asks Alice for a notification on how she's doing. Bob can look at images from cameras Alice has passed by while he enjoys his evening. (This feature is not included on the Demo yet)After some time into his placid watch, Bob gets a notification to his mobile. Turns out some pedestrian activity has been detected some blocks away from Alice. With a few clicks Bob checks the images from around that area. It looks like a couple took out their dog for a night walk. He decides not to change Alice's suggested path and goes back to his dinner.Once Alice gets home she sends a last notification to Bob thanking him for his watch. Bob sees Alice has arrived home safe while brushing his teeth, turns off his application and goes to sleep.ReferencesOffice of Postsecondary Education of the U.S. Department of Education & The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).Griffin, T., Cramer, D., & Powers, M.

 Recycling rate in Singapore is quite low, with plastics at a mere 7%. Even if people know what materials are recyclable, they often don't have the habit of placing those items into recycling instead. Let's use technology to train people to build this habit! 
 For far too long, the healthcare industry has been woefully far behind the technological boom of the last two decades. While those in the ivory towers of the extremely well-endowed research centers of the world have been able to take advantage of cutting edge advances, the typical inclusive effect of technology on the average consumer has not yet been received by healthcare consumers. Essentially, while data is being manipulated by facebook to show you that cool new product you didn’t know you were dying to buy, there are literally millions of people globally for whom the same innovations could mean lives saved. We at PlainDoc believe that it is time for this trend of subpar healthcare personalization to be transformed forever. 
 India is the third largest producer of electricity, yet a large part of its electricity needs is fulfilled by Diesel Generators.The Diesel generator market is growing in India and is expected to reach USD 1.2 Billion by 2020. From telecom towers, to hospitals and corporate offices and manufacturing facilities depend heavily on Diesel Gen-sets to provide for a power backup. In the as - is scenario, the Diesel generator manufacturers and owners depend heavily on manual scheduled maintenance to ensure that they do not malfunction and continue to operate optimally.  Needless to say a manual process is error prone and inefficient leading to malfunction of the Gen-sets. In the age of Industrial IOT Gen-sets qualify as critical infrastructure and a real time monitoring is necessary.

An easy, and intuitive way to find meals that meet your specific dietary needs. 
 The inspiration for this idea came from our own experience of challenges we dealt with on an ongoing basis to manage groceries at home. Be it making a list of items to shop, predicting the consumption trend or driving down to the shop, it does take significant amount of time out of our busy lives. To back our experience, there are stats which indicate that we spend on an average about 41 minutes purchasing grocery every week. This is such a big waste of human productivity time that could be put to better use. We spend at least 30 minutes going back and forth to the market. Besides the time wasted, we are also increasing our carbon footprint. Shopkeepers need to stock items in their retail stores, which has an associated cost to get items from the manufacturer to the distributor to the retailer. If we could order directly from the manufacturers or online distributors, we would get products at reduced price and reduce the carbon footprint. There are technology enablers out there such as Amazon IoT framework and Amazon's affiliate APIs that could help automate our grocery purchase experience. 
 I have always wondered the possibility of being able to make insightful decisions that could impact productivity over time. Then it came "all I need is the face, then I can understand what the mouth can't say", meaning i could tie people feelings to productivity by interpreting expressions. This spurned up the idea, emoCam.

 The inspiration behind David is to solve two major challenges in any mode of transport . David , a personal assistant measure the alertness index of a driver ( could be a personal / public vehicle ) based on a few questions that have been compiled after talking to experts and medical advisors from the field . The alertness index advises a driver whether he is alert enough to hit the road or should he find any alternative mode of transport . This is a crucial step , we believe , in reducing the number of driver induced errors in accidents . Another core feature of David is that it suggests a time at which a user has to depart to reach his preferred destination on his preferred time schedule , based on his preferred mode of transport . Thus David intends to provide 3 major qualities to it's end users - Alertness , safety and efficiency .Alertness IndexAlertness index is a simple questionnaire for a driver that calculates the alertness index of the individual thereby letting him know how alert he can be in his job of driving . It asks simple questions that includes info about the amount of time he has slept , the number of hours he has spent driving in the recent past and use of alcohol and / or other alertness depriving substances . The algorithm analyses the answers given and calculates a rating that can have a maximum of 96 . A score of above 76 indicates high alertness and that the user is fit to drive . A score between 60 and 76 indicates normal alertness and the user is advised to be extra vigilant in driving and a score below 60 is considered below par and the user is advised to use alternative modes of transport or find other drivers for the same trip . The algorithm allocates weight to each answer based on the importance of the answers compiled with the help of experts in the field . End users can use this feature to significantly reduce driving errors that can lead to accidents and mishaps . The algorithm for attention index calculation can be found hereDepartByDepartBy is another core feature of the app with which a departure time is predicted to the user after he enters the source and destination addresses , preferred time of arrival expected . Separate times are given for transport by means of a personal vehicle , a cab , a shared cab and public transport . The time predicted calculates the same based on data received from Google Maps , Weather updates , Traffic updates , accident / road work info and historical data . The algorithm allocates weight to each factor considered , consolidates the result obtained and delivers time in 24 hour format for each mode of transport . DepartBy is a feature we believe can help improve the efficiency and punctuality of users using the app .Other featuresSmartBusSmartBus feature allows easy access to bus schedules, fares, trip planner, bike rack use, Smart value pass, MyConnector for regular users of the same .ThePeopleMoverThePeopleMover feature allows easy access to Station Guide, Ride Info, passes, tickets for users of the same .M-1 RailM-1 Rail info allows easy access to  Station stops, schedule, tickets for users of the same .How I built itAlertness Index was built using an algorithm that analyses the user responses and gives weight after compiling usual and normal alertness levels of individuals based on their reaction to scenarios . Depart By feature was built using Google Maps API , open weather API and other traffic APIs . The algorithm for attention index calculation can be found hereChallenges I ran intoDeveloping the algorithm for alertness index was the biggest challenge as it involved extensive research and data from experts in the field and common accident causes analysis . DepartBy feature , thought easier , took longer time to complete because of complexities involved in getting data from various APIs used .What's next for DavidThe alertness index algorithm required rigorous testing from users and the algorithm needs to be perfected after more research , opinions and adding questions that can help us predict a better alertness Index scoreBuilt Withandroidgoogle-mapsm-1railsmartbusthepeoplemoverweatherTry it outplay.google.com      Submitted to    Go Detroit    Created by  Developed every single bug you can find in hereRoyce Raju BeenaLoves travelling , following football( mostly ARSENAL) , bike rides .

 India is the country of villages. As India consumes largest amount of ground water in the world (230 cubic kilometres of groundwater per year), and main source of ground water in villages are 'wells'. 95% of these wells are in very bad condition and contains bad quality water. Villagers and farmers with lack of knowledge use this water in their daily life for general use like bathing, washing and also plantation which affects the health of people and also quality and quantity of the field production.It is very difficult to monitor the quality of each well on daily basis and hence IoT based systems can be very helpful for authorities to  monitor the condition of water and take remedial measures for betterment of water quality. 
  
 The inspiration came from the government of India and Twitter, Recently the people of India started posting on twitter about the conditions of trains, surprisingly the government has been responsive and fixing the issues. I hope the same for Mexico 
 The idea comes from one of the team members, when one day he discovered that his electric bill was too high. This led him to research to find some way to measure the electrical consumption of his house.Found the Open Energy Monitor website. It is a system that allows to measure the electrical consumption using Arduino. This changed everything because he did not depend on third parties to do an analysis of his appliances.Suddenly he looked at the refrigerator, what was happening? This appliance was the most consuming per day in the whole house by far.Investigating more in depth he discovered several interesting matters about refrigerators. But perhaps, the most important was that due to the heat that concentrates behind these devices, their electricity consumption increases between 15% and 25%.This was the seed of this project.How a refrigerator worksThe operation of a refrigerator consists of transferring the heat from the interior to the exterior. This allows the temperature inside the fridge to be much lower than the ambient temperature of the room.If there is not enough place to be exhausted, the hot air that expels the appliance itself condenses in the back, affecting compressor efficiency. This causes a longer time needed to cool and as a consequence, an increase in the electric consumption. 
 We want software engineering and product development teams to run at algorithm speed.We want to be efficient. We want to free our creative minds from updating, checking and correcting data so that we can get on with solving interesting problems.We want to be able to trust the status of our reports without having to waste time tediously sifting through data. We want information when we need it.We want to be able to do this with ease, without changing our processes.This is the inspiration behind stratejos. 
 Mexico City is in the top 10 largest cities in the world, there is many ways to move in the city, METRO with 12 lines and 192 stations is one the most important and covers most of the city, METROBUS with 6 lines (and planing new one) and 208 stops, BUS (which includes all their variants, RTP, BUS,etc),  TAXI, ECOBICI, and many more.But what if you are new in the city? Or even people who lives in the city just have one or two well-know areas. There is no webpage or app which connects all options to move in the city. CITYSCOPE wants to help people who lives or visit the city to find the best option to move in it. The  
 Passionate for challenges and development, our team was inspired in getting together all the member’s skills (back-end, front-end developers, devops, design and UI/UX expertise) and creating an innovative product to simplify the modern communication: a multi platform social media chat app. Everyone has access to different social medias, however many people are spread. Hootchat can integrate different social medias in one place, simplifying the communication of the every day’s life. 
 Couples of years ago we tried to develop a project which helps a farmer to choose appropriate crop to improve the crop production as well as the income. But due to the scarcity of data we could not able to develop that app. During that time we survey and talked with some our relatives who are directly and closely related to the farming. We observed that farmers choose a crop to harvest based on the previous couple of years crop production, harvesting cost and price. They choose a crop usually based on information available from the agriculture officer, the memorized data or information collects from their neighborhood peoples. Agriculture officer usually advice farmers based on some text based data. But retrieve useful information from the memorized data or a text based data cannot help a farmer to visualize meaningful information. Also these data set has limited data which is unable to effectively help any decision making process.USDA has several data set which has a lot of agriculture related data. By leveraging these data we can help farmers in choosing and comparing several corps. In PowAgri we leverage the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to help the farmers to choose the most productive and valuable crops by visualizing data in the most intuitive way. The main target user of PowAgri are the farmers, so they want to use any tools which  can help farmers in the easiest way. We can visualize information by choosing many attributes, but this is not a practical way for a farmers. Keeping this issues in minds we design our app PowAgri which is an easy to use tools to help farmers in their decision making process. Just a single tap farmers can visualize the information and can make appropriate decision using these data.App IntroFarming is the greenest business. Like any other business, in agriculture farm, farmer keep a log of their crops or products productivity like how much they produce, price or harvested area. Keeping this farm logs or data will be worthy, if they can get meaningful information to improve their farm production. USDA also maintains several dataset to keep the agriculture related data. Except the researcher or a text based data is not very meaningful to farmer, because retrieving meaningful information or analysis is very troublesome for a farmer from these dataset. To resolve these issues, we develop a very easy to use app “PowAgri” to provide a meaningful insight to both the farmer and the researcher so that they can visualize all the data in a meaningful way.Key Features:  PowAgri is very easy to use tools for every farmers and researcher to select best crops or compare crops in several attributes. Just a single tap PowAgri visualize data to farmers for helping the decision making process.  PowAgri helps farmers to choose appropriate crops for a particular state based on some farming characteristic like yield, price received, area harvested or area planted.  Farmers can get insight about which crops is the most productive in their surrounding areas.  Compare crop tools helps farmers and researchers  to know which crops harvest better than the other crops in terms of yield, production, price, expense and other several attributes.  Price analysis tools helps farmers to know the market price of a particular crop in a particular state  PowAgri provide the expense information to the farmers for a particular states.Overall PowAgri leverage the USDA NASS data set to help farmers in their decision making process.How It WorksChallenges I ran intoThree years ago we tried to develop an app like PowAgri. But in that time we did not have enough information, as a result we could not complete our project. On the other hand, after seeing a lot of data in USDA datasets we faced a sweet problem: how to visualize the data to farmers for helping in their decision making process. There are several ways we can visualize data by choosing desired options. But it is not very easy way for a farmer. As our main target user are farmers, we spend a many many hours to design the UX of the apps. We studied a lot of survey, reports and agriculture guidelines to design our app. We also spend a lot of times to determine which information is very important to the farmers so that they can use this information to improve their farming. But at the end we successfully mange and visualize these to the user in the easiest way.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofAt the very beginning of the PowAgri development process, we were afraid that how to manage these huge dataset and how we can visualize these data to the farmers so that they can use this tool without any headache. We spend hours and hours to simplify the data visualization process. We spend countless hour and design a lot of wireframe to develop an user friendly UX and data visualization. After several mockups wireframe design we are happy that we conclude to a most intuitive and easy to use tools “PowAgri” for every farmers.We developed the app in such modular way that any one can easily add a new analysis module in the project. We opensource the project in the Github.We already published our PowAgri app in the Google play store for the public users.Future of PowAgriWe successfully integrate almost all the planned and necessary features in the PowAgri. Despites these features, we have a plan to add an offline caching feature into PopwAgri. This caching feature will help the farmers to cache regularly used analysis in offline mode so that they can use this analysis without internet.Built Withandroidandroid-studiousda-datasetTry it outplay.google.comgithub.comwww.facebook.com      Submitted to    USDA Innovation Challenge    Created by  I am the team leader of PowAgri.

 Developers sometimes spend a significant amount of time searching StackOverflow to find a fix for a code error that turned out to be a relatively simple (and solvable) problem. Why not automate that search process to find the optimal solution, and have it implemented within the code without any human intervention? 
 When driving to a location, wouldn't be magical if your favorite navigation app could not only show you parking lot locations, but even individual parking lot spaces available? What if you could be reminded by text that your time was up and add time to that reservation by text as well? We wanted to make a computer-vision powered web-app/REST API parking lot owners could set up easily to attract more costumers and make finding parking in our city  breeze.  
 Shortly after I left my previous startup, which I cofounded in 2013, I started pondering on some of my good and bad experiences. And, one thing I realized is that their is a recurring pattern in the way I communicate , collaborate and lead others. I found many patterns are conducive to my teams growth and where I struggled to provide better results. These patterns have lot to do with, how I feel and think and therefore I engage with my teams. Many of it was subjective, therefore I felt it will be good to objectify the emotions, and how they are pursued by others in my team. This quest had lead me to a very interesting journey in human pschyology and organization behavior. Thus born my new startup idea, Emotional Analytics to manage people and projects, DeepAffects. I am applying the artificial intelligence to traditional project management, and extract the emotional insights to predict at-risk tasks, team dynamics, productivity, conflicts, trust and happiness.  
 I observed that lot of QA, Dev, and teams were struggling while testing rest API calls. They make rest api call from one tool and document on another tool. How cool it would be if we make rest call, test rest call and document those request/response payloads from single tool.   
 Our inspiration to create Updated Issues Basket  was all the complaints we got from people that get spammed by JIRA notifications and yet they have hard time tracking what is new in the JIRA issues. With such plugin, it is now easy to stay on top of the updates on JIRA issues that you are interested in and react on time. Never miss an important issue update again! 
 We are 3 founders with more than 7 decades of experience across Technologies, Industries & Geographies. With our variety, we analyzed certain basic aspects (below) which led to the inspiration.Deluge of mails & managing is an herculean taskDisparate tools used to manage your team, activities, tasks etc. & they work in silosEmail is main media of communication & is not effectively used in projects Tools like MS project etc. are expensive, steep learning curve & does not trickle to the last team memberWork transition is a fixed handicap which normally consumes lot of resources## What it doesU@Work is envisaged to be a simple and light weight project management solution on top of Office 365 Outlook platform. So, from the email window, with intuitive user interface and menu options, Users for example can define project work elements, meetings, tasks, allocate resources and also track progress from a rich visual Dashboard.U@Work Creates a folder structure (as that of a Project WBS structure) across the team & any correspondence with respect to a specific project/activity/ will be routed to the recipient project/activity in the same order. Tasks can be associated to projects & activities, people can be assigned to activities and tasks, meeting action items can be tracked and health of projects monitored with data & metrics providing insightful infographics auto-rolled up to the Dashboard. This automatically adheres to ISO & COBIT.Task & Meeting lifecycle Management.Real time dashboard on various status of Tasks / Action items.Works on Office 365 & Outlook.com.A Patent Pending product, presently, U@Work is being realised as a product add-in, integrated to work with Microsoft Outlook Office 365 and Outlook.com email platform.Some of the project management features realised so far are; Manage Work: Users can create, manage by directly defining project, activities, sub-activities etc. and assign people to a project, activities from within the context of an email in Outlook. Allows multiple project creation and can be managed from user interface and monitored from Dashboard.Dashboard: U@Work add in provides a dashboard view where the users can view metrics of project summary, task status, meeting metrics and Gantt chart.Team on Same Page: Manager shares project details to team members with a single click. The sharing happens via email being sent to people whom activities, sub-activities etc. have been assigned.Auto-Organise folders: On receipt of first project email, similar project (folder) structure as configured by Manager will be created in every team member’s mail box automatically, thus bringing uniformity in structuring project & communication across team, ground up.Auto-Organise project emails: From UI, when any team member sends email with context set by selecting Project, Activity, Sub-activity etc., emails get automatically routed to respective folders in the recipient’s mailbox. Communication is organised ground up and saves effort and time.Manage Tasks: From UI, create tasks against project, activity, sub-activity etc., and assign to any team member. Team members can update task status and the data is rolled to Manager and dashboard.Manage Meetings: Covers elements such as invite, calendar, meeting minutes, track outcome, mainly decisions and action items.

Refer below URL for installation procedure:http://www.nascorgroup.com/help/uatwork/V2/index.html How we built itC#, EWS, Angular JS, SQLServer. Azure, Microsoft Graph, Office 365 REST APIChallenges we ran intoAs U@Work rides on existing email platforms, the biggest challenge lies in bringing feature parity and same user experience, by hiding from users, technology & implementation complexity, barriers and limitations. The APIs and plug-in integration approach is not the same and varies from provider to provider. This can be analogous to developing an application with same features and user interface to run on different operating systems.Getting to depth, The APIs and plug-in development and integration approach between Microsoft Outlook desk top version and Microsoft Outlook Office 365 is totally different. For instance, MAPI is used for Microsoft Office desk top version, which is different from using the latest & evolving Microsoft Graph technology for Exchange & Office 365, which is again different from using web hooks provided by Outlook APIs to directly interact with Outlook as part of Office 365.Plug-in technology is also evolving and not exercised by many so far. Initially, while examining feasibility options, lot of time and effort went in, even to make samples work. Also, lack of documentation aggravated the problem and debugged to figure out missing pieces and discover remedies. For example, first instance to make U@Work visible in the email window was a significant effort. Next steps to process user actions, when clicked, were no different.U@Work requires to interact with user mail box and email exchange server. As Microsoft Graph is also evolving, very few APIs are exposed limiting functionality that can be realised. Also, had to experiment a lot, due to insufficient technical documentation and usage examples. Another uncertainty is to battle possible changes to APIs, as they are still in beta and not released to production. Already faced a situation once, where change in API syntax broke U@Work. Presently, we use a combination of both Microsoft Graph and web hooks for Outlook APIs.Emails can arrive to any mail box at any point in time. U@Work to have to talk to Outlook and Exchange server and get notifications,  to be in sync with mail arrivals and user actions. Plug-in request to exchange are treated asynchronously and honoured on low priority. So, to synchronise and process in real time, (even when users have not logged into the mail box and U@Work) a separate service was built to run 24*7 to run in the background.With Microsoft Outlook Office 365, mail box can be accessed from popular browsers such as Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome and Microsoft Outlook desk top versions (2013 & 2016). When it comes to user interface, size and form factor of the dedicated pane exposed for plug-ins to render varies between browser and desktop email clients. Also, there is no feature parity yet between browser and desktop version. For example, in case of Outlook desktop version plug-in can appear in the main menu bar. This feature is yet to be released by Microsoft for browsers. Ended up adding extra plumbing program code to address this.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWon the Best Startup Award in CeBitCIO Review named us as a company to look out for.Appreciation from the PMI India Chapter.What we learnedBeing an entrepreneur is very challenging & satisfying.What's next for U@WorkMake email window with U@Work as a HUB for all Office365 apps (U@Work as an interface to MS Project online, TFS, Sharepoint, Planner, SFB, Teams, Groups etc) & also other Monolithic tools like SAP, Oracle etc in a very innovative way & automatically caters customer’s requirement.More productivity featuresSpecific data analytics with machine learning.All conversations (text, AV) to be tagged to a project/activity & the files generated stored in One Drive / AzureCurrently project dashboard being generated, going forward program management dashboard for an accountU@Work has been realized on O365 & Outlook.com.

 One of the team Member's grandparent had recently undergone a bypass surgery. Post surgery he had to be placed under constant monitoring because of the delicate situation. Since it was close to impossible to have any individual under a constant monitor and not everyone can afford a nurse or a doctor we realised that there was no mobile solution in the market that was effective enough to monitor the health situation of an individual. That's when we came up with the idea. 
 The team wanted to build a partly physical and partly emulated implementation of a water conservation ecosystem concept. The resources available on the ARTIK10 (cores, memory, speed, networking interfaces) make it capable of doing more than just physical device monitoring and control.The concept of Ripples is that it can, of course, control a physical system, but also host a server that is highly performant when written in Go.

 Every year on average 38 infants die from being left in the car. I can’t even imagine what goes through the family after an incident like this happens. In an age of AI and smart connected devices these type of deaths need to be prevented. Having an edge device run the CV modules is cost effective because device is not sending images for processing to the cloud and also addresses any privacy concerns.As a parent of a 2 year old I feel devastated when I see news like this and I wanted to propose a solution that prevents this. 
 Our team has been an Office 365 / SharePoint consulting service for the last four years. We began to notice that small and medium-sized businesses were continually asking us for the same features: an Intranet platform that is simple to manage, able to quickly create content, and easy to use by people of all skill sets. Considering the short adoption rates of platforms such as SharePoint, we decided to provide a different experience that helps SMBs better adopt O365 and leverage all of its feature.What It DoesUPTEAMIST allows teams to quickly create and share announcements, pages, links, documents, and events. Additionally, users can manage permissions and tags so that content is always readily available to those who need it. The UPTEAMIST platform integrates directly with Office 365 so that team members can use their enterprise email addresses to access the system and start sharing instantly.How We Built ItUPTEAMIST is built on Azure and integrates with Microsoft Graph API, SharePoint REST API, and StripeJS. A Node.js application manages the subscription platform, while the user-facing portal is built on .NET with AngularJS. We have been working on the project since March 2017.Challenges We EncounteredAs UPTEAMIST integrates directly with SharePoint, most of the challenges emerged as we worked with the SharePoint REST API. For example, in the case of a document upload, UPTEAMIST needs to contend with not only its own built-in permission system, but also SharePoint's permission system. To effectively handle this, we needed to ensure that the permissions set on UPTEAMIST were mirrored in SharePoint.We had many internal discussions concerned with how to best simplify the interface and the actions provided to end users. If we made it too simple, the platform might not have enough features to make the service useful. If we made it too complicated, we figured we might as well just continue recommending SharePoint. With the issue of balance in mind, the design team went to work - and continues to adjust and update - to ensure that we are providing the right amount and type of features to our users.AccomplishmentsOverall, we are very proud of the work our team has done to get the platform up and running. The connection to Azure AD is working great, as is the connection to Stripe to manage subscriptions and payments. As of this application's date of submission, already two dozen alpha users are on the platform and providing us with insightful feedback.What We LearnedAs an agency that provides consulting services, we had to re-learn processes and procedures from the product development perspective. Although the design, development, and quality control methods were roughly the same, much more thought needed to be dedicated towards marketing, customer feedback, and support. We want to ensure that our product answers a community need, and that new feature requests are realized and implemented quickly. Our goal is to improve the tool so that it perfectly fits the needs of modern, small to medium-sized organizations.What's Next for UPTEAMISTFor the remainder of 2017, our plan is to continue to work with our alpha - and eventually beta - users to refine our product features. Our product road map for 2018 is arranged into quarters. In the first quarter, we want to move UPTEAMIST out of beta and into V1. The second quarter will be dictated by the feedback we receive from our initial users, and it will include the implementation / integration of Project Online and Dynamics CRM Online. The third quarter will include rolling-out an iOS / Android application developed using Xamarin. In the fourth quarter, we plan to work with the Cognitive Services API to integrate speech recognition so that users can interact directly with the Intranet via voice command.A quick introductionhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/EL4uo8tZ6LUBuilt With.netangular.jsc#graph-apinode.jssharepoint-rest-apisignalrTry it outsubscription.upteamist.comwww.upteamist.com      Submitted to    Hack Productivity 3    Created by  I contributed as the product manager and ensure of the progression of our first feature set and respect of the timelineKhoa Quach

 At OK GROW! most apps we build need to integrate with a legacy REST API of some sort. Meteor of course provides simple functions for making raw HTTP calls but once you've been working with DDP for a while you don't want to go back.We picture a world where developers demand a DDP API (remember when developers overthrew their SOAP overlords in the Great RESTful API Revolution of 2006?) and we want to make it easier for legacy apps to produce a live updating DDP API. 
 Our inspiration first comes from a female member in our team where she shared with us a story about her experience in a case regarding gender inequality. To sum it up, our current society tends to view woman as incapable of solving problems regarding technology and take it as a joke when their opinion is raised. Like the metaphor “Rome wasn’t build in a day”, cases regarding gender inequality can’t be solve in a day but takes the hearts of everyone to overcome it. At this age and time, our inspiration also comes from how gaming apps make their user enjoy using it while also becoming loyal customers of the app. From that, our team decided to make our app to be sort of a game where user can enjoy using it without the fear of being restricted. As for the concept of the game, our inspiration comes from how Dating Websites work. With stereotype being the biggest issue in fields related to technology, this inspiration strikes us on how people use dating website to find their soulmates regardless of who they are on the other side of the “screen”.         With all the inspirations combine, we finally sort it all out and created an application call TheFriendZone where user of any gender and age can join and have fun.

 As students of a research oriented high school, we often found it difficult to find time to pursuing research projects while keeping up with school work. To solve this dilemma, we decided to build a web application that would focus on mitigating the time-consuming factors of the research process.  
 "Fake news" are becoming increasingly rampant among news outlets and media in general. People are overwhelmed with information from all sources and fact-checking an article is too time-consuming. 
  
 Today's newspapers are filled with stories of violence and abuse. What if we could help prevent that? What if we could make every person feel safe. What if every person knew that there is someone who is watching over them and concerned about their safety? What if we could prevent rape, abuse, harassment? What if every person knew what happens in a particular area before even stepping there? What if every person was armed with knowledge? That's what we wanted to do. We wanted to make a better safer world for every person out there. A better world.

 Marketing, sales and support teams share a lot of information on a daily basis. Even with a lot of great CRM tools on the market, the integration of these teams is not seamless. When the marketing team uses a solution outside JIRA, it is hard to share information and keep track of deals and sales if the support team is all using JIRA Service Desk.Kanoah CRM fills the gap bringing all team together into the same environment. Marketing and sales can create CRM projects to manage their leads and link them to support or even development tickets. These teams will love to use Kanoah CRM since it provides valuable information very fast, with great usability. 
 This project introduces an innovative IoT system aimed at reducing the amount of resources used by waste collection agencies in the U.S. The correct partitioning of trash into bins at the earliest stages of the garbage disposal lifecycle can minimize man hours allocated to the separation of recyclables from non-recyclables (and organics from non-organics) at such facilities, eradicate the traditional garbage collection process and therefore optimize budgets used by relevant agencies on this matter. Recycling is an important topic given that improperly discarded waste may have a negative impact on the natural environment. Alternatively, recycling reduces the need for producing raw materials, therefore preserving the rainforest.Our goal was to solve part of this global problem, by helping waste collection agencies function in a more efficient manner. 
 ThriftFly is a network to connect frequent fliers connect and share incredible airfare deals. Save money on your next vacation or dream adventure to your bucket list destinations by finding deals shared by users on the appAdd, tip and report expired flight dealsUsers sign up with 25 Kin added to their account as sign up bonus. User can then add a flight deal from the add deal page. User inputs the source location, destination location, date of onward and return journeys, airline code and arrival and departure time and dates. On addition 15 Kin is awarded to the user for sharing the deal. Thriftfly then verifies the deal online checking the average prices on the same route and make the deal live so that it becomes available to other users on the platform. Other users on the platform can then favorite the deal if they like it, report the deal as expired if the fare is no longer available. Every tip transfers 1 Kin to the user who posted the deal. Reporting expired deals on verification also fetches the user 1 KinThus ThrifyFly is a user controlled network where users share data verified by the admin and checked for errors by fellow users.LeaderboardLeaderboard enables users to see top contributors in terms of points earned(Kin), deals added and deals expired reported.

 Congestion in the cities are making people crazy. One day I had to move from one place to another in my city, normally I took me about 15 minutes but that day, the traffic was crazy and took around 55 minutes. That day I realized that the congestion was mainly caused by the people in their cars, because around a 90% of these were occupied by only one person. As soon as I realized that, I started to work next to a group of friends in these project so that we could promote a more sustainable mobility.

 A year Ago in August 2014 I decided to join Mexico city and its entrepreneurial environment. Working in an innovation technology center (CTIN) and spending the rest of my day in communities for programmers and hackers (as DEV.F). trying to figure out a pain that most of people suffer and it’s funny because being in this city for 6 months is easy to think as normal spending 2 to 3 hours in transportation for join the office if you use a car, near to 1.5 to 2 hours in public transportation that is not comfortable, secure or even safe. That’s when I realize the pain I was looking for was there “A lack of quality in public transportation service over Latin America (not just Mexico)”. Transportation should be easy, affordable, comfortable, trustworthy, safe and customer first. That’s how the whole idea of combining on demand routes with Van sharing comes up.  
 For many Yilan residents, the easiest and the quickest way to travel to Taipei and other parts of Taiwan is via Freeway No.5 and through Hsuehshan Tunnel. But the huge demand for the four-lane highway has resulted in heavy congestion, especially on the weekends. For a quicker, safer way home for all Yilan people, we propose a different toll collection system based on the current traveling speeds on different segments of the highway, the slower the speed, the higher the toll rates, thus encouraging drivers to travel through alternative routes when the highway gets too crowded. When the speed on the highway falls below 30km/hr, we set up the toll rate to be as high as 12 times of the original! We believe this system can effectively reduce the amount of vehicles entering the highway whenever a congestion occurs, thus raising the overall travel speed on the highway. 
 One of our very close friends is extremely allergic to sesame seeds and unfortunately she spends a lot of her time reading the ingredient lists on packages before she can allow herself to eat it. We wanted to make an application which would allow people with these type of allergies or dietary restrictions to not have to worry about wasting their time doing so and not have to worry about reading the packages inaccurately. Some packaging has small writing, is hard to read, or isn't on a barcode-based database. We decided to attract a broader audience by not only including allergies, but also including people that have particular dietary restrictions. This way everyone can enjoy the food they want to eat without all that time reading the ingredient list.

 Based on a survey of 14,000 households, the American Society of Travel Agents reports that it is currently seeing the highest numbers of consumers booking through travel agents in three years. The most common reason provided for doing so? Travelers said it saved them time.Though, travel agencies’ business isn’t expected to return to pre-internet levels, online booking has shown travelers the frustrations that can come with booking travel themselves—and that outsourcing the stress of arranging travel can be worthwhile [1]. You can also find more statistics that paint a bright future for travel agents here [2] . But the current process of interacting with multiple travel agents and choosing between them is not streamlined, and usually involves filling of clunky forms multiple times. This bot is a concept to show how to get around this problem, by interactively collecting travel preferences over chat and sending them to nearby travel agents for them to respond with customized, creative travel plans. Also, there is no need for the travelers to download any new app or navigate a complex website in a mobile screen. All that they need to do is start chatting with the Travel Agent Connector bot from FB Messenger.[1] https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/travel-agent/488282/[2]  http://www.dcsplus.net/blog/5-stats-that-paint-a-bright-future-for-travel-agents 
  
  
 Amazon has a policy stating that if a product you buy from them has a lower price within a week of your purchase, you are entitled to a refund of the difference. Unfortunately, many aren't aware of this policy, and even if they are, it goes unused as it's a real hassle to do all the required legwork.Kickback is something that people could and should actually use.  A few days before LA Hacks, I bought a scooter. Just yesterday, the price dropped $10. Because the application hadn't yet been built, I had to go through the "traditional" process of verifying what I'd paid, checking the new price, finding the dates to see if I was eligible, and finally the tedious task of contacting Amazon. This experience made me realize how needed this product was.Kickback has literally no downsides to the consumer, and offers huge potential upsides.How it WorksUsers log in through Google in our mobile application (or soon via a webapp), which also serves as a beautiful list of pending and successful refunds. We check your Gmail Inbox for new Amazon orders, and watch for fluctuations in price. If something drops (monitored via Amazon's Product Advertising API), not only do we recognize that you're owed a refund, but we also send an email on your behalf (from your account using the Gmail REST API) to Amazon, requesting that the difference be refunded to you.Your only interaction with Kickback will be to sign up once, and then receive push notifications whenever we've saved you money.AccomplishmentsWe're pretty happy to have made a simple way to passively take advantage of a great policy that you may not have known existed. In terms of technical achievements, we were able to build a relatively scalable MVP in a short amount of time; we organized worker execution with simple in-memory schedulers that could probably handle hundreds or thousands of users as is.We also made a really pretty app.What's next for KickbackThis service could be very easily scaled; as more and more people automatically monitor products and get refunds, request overhead goes down due to overlap. The service could stay operational by charging a small percentage of each refund amount, or through donations. We built this on Azure, so it'd be dead simple to scale by switching to an actual Mongo cluster and a standard microservice architecture. In the future, we'd also want to use some of Azure's built in caching/queueing features to make this a bit more asynchronous; requests are currently done inline because of time constraints. The fact that Azure did basic DNS for us was amazing, huge props for that feature.Built Withamazonazuregmailgoogleiosmongodboauthpythonxcode      Submitted to    LA Hacks 2015Winner                Second Place                  Created by  UI/UX, Concept + Design Implementation Benjamin Zweigwhat upI built the backend systems that monitor your gmail inbox and Amazon orders.Matt CondonI built the iOS client, and set up login through the Gmail and Parse APIs.Bryce Dougherty

 At the very beginning of my job hunting years, I approached the question, “So, can you tell us a little about yourself” as if I were helping the interviewer know ALL about Halé past, present, and future. After not getting a series of jobs, I couldn't help but think, "What is going wrong?" Then I took a class called, "Presenting a Brand Called Me" at Skidmore College which opened my eyes to see my common interview misconceptions. Mainly, the organizations want to know a how I would add value them through my skill set and accomplishments. After learning how to respond to common interview questions, I felt a greater sense of confidence. I want the same for others, especially people who do not have traditional career preparation services. Access Granted has been my first attempt at building a functional app. I am glad that I can share advice, add value to other people, and potentially contribute to their future successes. I had a fantastic time learning to program and code Access Granted and cannot wait to grow the idea in the near future. 
 When we first joined the hackathon, we began by researching the various large-scale changes that happen during a drought crisis and how they affect the humans and ecosystems that are susceptible to changes in water abundance. We began with California but wanted to keep an open mind about how this may apply to other parts of the world where drought is an issue. We quickly found that drought caused far more changes than just a simple shortage of water: it was responsible for an increased salinity in groundwater and quicker soil runoff rates, meaning the water that is applied to the soil doesn't stay put. This poses a major issue for farmers who have to resort to overwatering, which becomes increasingly expensive, and less efficient with a decreasing water supply. Additionally, farmers see a decrease in crop yield when their plants are in a saltier soil. 
  
 We often use email messages to communicate with different groups of people. We start new email threads every day and sometimes, it is difficult to remember all the recipients that we should include in the TO, CC or BCC fields. We spend a lot of time digging into our inbox and finding all the right people from certain groups and adding them to the email. We can easily miss someone if we do this process manually...Our team members experience above problem almost every day, which inspired us to create the Molecula - Office 365 Add-In for Outlook. Molecula makes it easier to interact with the people and groups most important to you! 
    According to "Impact analysis of transportation capability by speed limit in xueshan tunnel",the loading capacity in hsuehshan tunnel is 2400 car numbers per hour, but now it often over 5000 car numbers per hour. The car flow in highway greatly exceed the capacity, which cause serious traffic jam. To solve this problem, there are two aspects that we can do. First, reduce the car flow in traffic. Second, control the traffic flow in hsuehshan tunnel. The detailed information is as followed.1. Reduce car flow   In traffic transport industry, modal switching is a great way to decrease traffic flow. However, there are several disadvantages to ban users from these methods. For example, it is too inconvinient. Users have to search buses, trains and all kinds of public transport ways and they even have to find out how they move whey they are in Ilan. The result is they just give up and drive their own cars. Besides, people don't know what they get if they switch other modals, such as, how much time or money they can save. This is a huge problem because bus can afford 5 times of people compared with private cars. To sum up, we want to be a platform that resolve inconvinent problems. We will collect all kinds of information they need and provide some discounts to add incentives. These can encourage people use public transports system and alternative ways to reduce car flows.2. Control car flow in highway   According to  ”Franks Self-organized lane formation and optimized traffic flow in army ants,” if the car numbers per hour exceed 3000, the traffic jam will naturaly happen. We have to control the car flow to prevent natural traffic jam. Reservation system is a good way to control and estimate the car flow for concerned authorities to make further decisions. We can distribute the flow and warn people the expected jam. If we accumulate enough data, we can even give more information to residents. Thus, we want to distribute the flow into reserved lane and normal lane in some serious times like holidays or weekend. Buses and people who reserve on our app can drive on this lane (like high occupancy vehicle lane). Peolpe who want to save time and don't follow the rules drive on reserved lane. We will punish them with the help of eTag and License Plate Recognition System.    In conclusion, our idea is using carrot and stich approaches. On one hand, we encourage and make it easier for residents to use public transport ways. On the other hand, we strictly control flow on highway and give severe punishment who want to save time and break the rules. These income can use for subsidy of local residents.

 I have been wanting to get my feet wet with extensions for a while and this was a really fun experience. I thought it would be fun to try to build an at-a-glance twitch chat analysis tool for streamers and viewers alike to see the general mood of a chat.

 We have a strong passion for the strategy game Heroes of Might and Magic 3. It has one interesting game mechanic called “Fog of war”, the fog covers those parts of the map, where the player hasn’t walked with his game characters, hiding various artefacts and resources from the player. When player explores the map, the fog dispels and reveals all those hidden things. We believe that it is very similar to how people travel. Arriving at a new place, we don’t know anything about it and when we walk, we gradually discover it for ourselves, but while in the game we get resources and artefacts, in real life we get emotions and knowledge. We decided to apply this mechanics in our application. 
 Chat Translator started out as one of the many open-source Twitch-integrated projects I build live on stream with viewers at the Coding Cafe as Instafluff because I had viewers from all over the world that could speak Czech, Spanish, Dutch, German, and even Japanese but were limited to chatting in English. We created ChatTranslator the Chatbot and turned it into a global Twitch bot and it currently resides in 112 different channels and has translated more than 47 million characters since September 2018. I wanted to take the lessons learned from the chatbot and make it much more natural and integrated with less chat-spam for my community and others as well, and Twitch extensions were a perfect way for me to make it happen.DevelopmentI am a huge AWS fan and have used many of its services for almost a decade now in my own startups and in consulting for other businesses as well, but if not careful, it can get expensive. Chat Translator is a showcase to how, with the good architecture, AWS can be extremely cost-effective for even the penniest of the penny-pinchers.The Chat Translator extension was built using the Twitch ComfyKit with HTML/CSS/Javascript and its backend was built using NodeJS and ComfyTranslate running on the smallest instance of AWS Lightsail, which is a flat $3.50 / month, and one of these instances using the smart-caching system I built for the translations in combination with the $15 / million characters pricing of AWS Translate APIs should be able to currently handle hundreds of small/low-activity channels, about 20 medium-sized (~50-200 viewer) channels, or one really large channel for a total of less than $20 of overhead per month. With further development of the caching and language-detection system, this operating cost could be even lower. When done right, AWS can really make tight budgets go a long way.Technical ChallengesThere are several significant challenges that Chat Translator overcomes that might not be as obvious at first.Keeping the translation API calls budget-friendlyScaling real-time translation of active chat to multiple languages at the same timeHandling Twitch Emotes in the translation processSockets and real-time broadcasting of the translated message to viewersListening to Timeouts/Bans of users and broadcasting the deletion of corresponding messages.Designing to look like the familiar Twitch chat with status and sub badges, username colors, showing emotesAPI Limits & ScalingThe precursor to this extension, the ChatTranslator Chatbot, was already pushing the limits of a 15 million character monthly quota when I began working on the extension for this challenge. I made several improvements to the caching system because this extension may translate to 5 languages at the same time in a single channel so that I could keep the API costs low.The extension connects to the translation server via web sockets, but automatically connecting every viewer to the server will overload it quickly, so I made adjustments to also keep the connection count low and only translate languages as necessary.Twitch Chat QuirksTwitch chat messages are not normal text. It includes emotes represented as reserved keywords and replaced at render-time to images and translation APIs do not understand the emote names and often comes back broken. Chat Translator specially handles the quirks of Twitch chat messages in the translation process in order to preserve the meaning of the original text.Also, when a user is timed-out or banned from a channel, all messages from that user in the chat's history is deleted. Chat Translator is able to listen for these events and react as well.Lastly, in the native Twitch chat, users often have badges reflecting their role in the channel or a special status, such as moderator/bit-cheer/subscriber/etc. including channel-specific badges. Chat Translator's design keeps these badges and other aspects of chat intact so that they do not lose any social value or cause confusion for the user compared to the native chat.Chat Translator's FutureEven with the smart-caching and other systems put in place to help keep the API costs low, it is still a significant operational cost for one person and the bit monetization model doesn't necessarily fit well. After the challenge, I may look into a subscription model to be able to cost-scale the extension, but really the Chat Translator experience makes much more sense directly integrated into Twitch.I believe that Twitch is a truly unique platform because of its social aspect and is strengthened by the connections made on it, which becomes even clearer at events like TwitchCon where people who have only met through the platform can meet in-person for the first time and still celebrate their long-time friendships. This is one of the reasons I love Twitch and believe that Twitch and all of the streamers and users on it would greatly benefit if they could expand their audiences and their social circles beyond language barriers.If this extension were to win the challenge, among other things, I would like to spend the time with Twitch leadership to advocate for its native integration into Twitch before one of its competitors do.Built Withamazon-web-servicesaws-translatecsshtmljavascriptlightsailnode.jsTry it outchattranslator.instafluff.tv      Submitted to    Twitch AWS Extensions ChallengeWinner                Third Place                  Created by  Pizza and coffee fueled the development of this extension.

 Teams share sensitive information in JIRA all the time:  passwords, customer data, SSL certs, SSH keys, PHI.  But JIRA doesn’t provide end-to-end encryption for these secrets, so they live in JIRA unprotected or end up somewhere else, disconnected from the actual work.We wanted a safer way to store and share sensitive information in JIRA so we created Team Secrets. 
  
  
  
  
 Atlassian products are the de facto standards in agile software development. We use JIRA for tracking, Confluence for collaborating, Bambo for build and deploy and Hipchat for communication.When developing software it's also important to know the health of your software team. To measure team health an additional tool is needed. A tool that helps the underlying issues to surface as quickly and as effortlessly as possible without much drama.So we created TeamFlowApp, an addition to JIRA, based on AtlasKit, the brand new UI kit from Atlassian.Working in a multi-team agile software development environment the managers wanted to get valuable information from developer team members as quickly as possible and as easily as possible. Initially, we used simple daily emails to gather individual status summaries.As a logical next step we built a prototype responsive web app. Seeing the upcoming Atlassian CodeGeist competition we prepared the web app using AtlasKit and React. 
 Sea turtles demonstrate the ultimate lesson of ecology – that everything is connected.Sea turtles are a part of two vital ecosystems: beaches and marine systems. If sea turtles become extinct, both the marine and beach ecosystems will weaken. And since humans use the ocean as an important source for food and beaches for many kinds of activities, weakness in these ecosystems would have harmful effects on humans.Though sea turtles have been living and thriving in the world’s oceans for 150 million years, they are now in danger of extinction largely because of changes brought about by humans. If we alter the oceans and beaches enough to wipe out sea turtles, will those changes make it difficult for us to survive? And if we choose to do what’s necessary to save sea turtles, might we save our own future? (credit : www.bonaireturtles.org )one of the threats for sea turtles is egg poaching, During the nesting season, hunters comb the beaches looking for nesting females at night . Often, they will wait until the female has deposited her eggs to kill her. Then, they take both the eggs and meat. unfortunately the number of egg poaching are increasing every year, in Sangalaki, a small Island in Indonesia, this case increased by 120% compared to 2013. a local intitute, Yayasan Penyu Laut Indonesia (YPLI) said that almost 1200 egg are stolen by poacher per month in Pasemut Island during a nesting season.Sea turtles have played vital roles in maintaining the health of the world’s oceans for more than 150 million years. These roles range from maintaining productive coral reef ecosystems to transporting essential nutrients from the oceans to beaches and coastal dunes.this case successfully made our heart sink, so we hope this little tool we made can help out to ensuring sustainability of sea turtle's life. It is the right time for us to protect sea turtles and rebuild their populations to healthy levels as a vital step in ensuring healthy and resilient oceans for the future.The Problem, and The Solution we offerEgg Poaching is one of the major causes of Sea turtle Extinction. Since it happened a lot in Indonesia, then it become our responsibility to stop it. as a Computer Science student, we believe that by creating a Tool  and a System that could Initialize and start a Crowd/community based movement to protect Turtle's egg from poaching can do a little help to prevent Sea Turtle from Extinction.How it worksThis Penyu Ranger (Sea Turtle Ranger) Project consist of the tool, and an android app. we called the tool as "Penyusuar" (inspired from Mercusuar, an Indonesian Language for Lighthouse) made of Raspberry pi, a proper web cam and PIR sensor. this tool was built to help Rangers (a name we gave to those who volunteered as turtle conserver) protect eggs from poacher, it can detect if there are threats around the nest of turtle's egg. we divided the threats into three conditions, condition one, if there's predator(animal) around the nest Penyusuar will play a dog-barking sound to drive away the predator. condition two, if there's human around the nest our tool will define them as a threat or non-threat, if they're considered as a non-threat our tool will only detect their faces and upload it to our dropbox. and condition three if Penyusuar define the human as a real threat, if they approaching the nest and stay there for a certain distance and amount of time our tool will upload their faces to dropbox (as suspect) and inform all rangers  via SMS so rangers can make sure if there's a real threat and take care of it. The android app made to help rangers in order to manage the Penyusuar (located in each turtle nest) it will record the data of the Penyusuar installment including coordinate of the nest and Penyusuar location(automatically added), date of installment, number of eggs on the nest and the species of the turtle. this app will also give a reminder to the rangers on the 60th day since the installment that the egg is about to hatch, so Rangers can move the eggs to the conservatory and perform a semi-natural hatching. within our app rangers can manage Penyusuar record, show it in a Map, view uploaded photos, and also give rangers a statistical information about the number of threats per day shown on a chart.Challenges we ran intohow to help Turtle Conserver against Egg Poachinghow to develop a system that can save turtle from extinction.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofWe can work in pressure, and also in teamWe can contribute to save turtle from extinctionWhat we learnedWe learned that in order to save sea ecosystem, we cant miss a single part of it. Sea turtles have played vital roles in maintaining the health of the world’s oceans for more than 150 million years, but now they are in danger of extinction. We need to help them, that's what we need to in order to ensuring a healthy and resilient oceans for another million years.What's next for Penyu RangerOur next dream is to Refine the design of the tools, collaborate with local conservatory organization and apply this solution in real-life.Built Withandroidandroid-studiojavapythonraspberry-piubidotsTry it outgithub.comwww.slideshare.net      Submitted to    Fishackathon 2015    Created by  Ghiyats Hanif Iskandarman Jadda wa JadaSatria Rahmadi

 With increasing number of bots in the industry and the amount of data being generated, It is now the need of hour to bring Insights out of those raw data. With being part of one of the biggest RPA COE with hundreds of bots in production, I have always felt the need of a product or a solution that gives us powerful insights and forecast there by the overall efficiency of Bot, Process can be increased.When we came across the UI Path's Devpost hackathon, We were overjoyed to know that  we have got a platform to give all  our wild ideas a try and this dashboard is the result of all our thought process and hardwork over the period of time. 
 We were inspired to build this product because although there are a lot of text-to-speech assistive technologies for blind and vision impaired folks, we didn't think that it enabled a holistic web use experience.  We thought, "it's not enough to be read the text of a news article, we would want to know what was also in the images." Our project was also motivated by our interest to integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence into our work. 
 it is my daily problem, keeping my emails and my notes together, i tried many apps but the problem still exists you take a note outside your email client, and can't see it directly within your email message. so back and forth between my email and my notes made us to create something to solve the problem, and since it is useful to me i'm sure it will be useful for others

 The success of the Port depends on ensuring the safe passage of vessels in the waters and efficient port operations to minimize time at berth for loading and discharging  supplies of provisions and spares, while maintaining a focus on sustainability. Ship chandlers, lighter terminals and lighter operators play important roles in the provision of supplies to carriers at sea. A mother vessel will often request for various supplies from a range of different suppliers, either directly or through the services of ship chandlers. In response, these ship suppliers will truck the cargo to pre-arranged lighter boats for final delivery to the mother vessel.Currently, the arrival times of lighter boats and supply trucks are not coordinated, resulting in lengthy wait time for both landside and seaside. This “rush to wait, wait to rush” problem is limiting the terminal’s operational productivity.So we decided to take this as a challenge and create a solution for Ship chandlers, lighter terminals, boat operators and truck operators to effectively communicate and coordinate to improve the efficiency

 As the cook of the household, I often have a hard time trying to figure out who is coming back for dinner, how much to cook for dinner and what to cook for dinner. This resulted in food wastage, or unsatisfied house mates when you don't cook enough or cook something that they would prefer. This is a problem which all housewives, party/event organizers, and even overseas students staying with housemates (like me) always face! 
 This project comes from an idea I had while I was learning AI techniques in addition to my robotics skills, indeed I'm using UiPath for 3 years now. I recently take courses on Udemy about Machine Learning and Deep Learning to get familiar with these whole new subjects for me. Although, I took some tutorials to learn how to code in Python.All this together, I ended up with the idea of creating a robot allowing non-datascientists to create Machine Mearning models easily and as quickly as possible. Moreover, I welcomed an AI student for an internship of 4 months, so I definitely associated him to the project and we made this together. 
  
 Remote teams is not something new nowadays. In the age of outsourcing there is a pretty decent chance that one day you come to the office and realise that nobody is there in the middle of the working day or during the estimation meeting.So there is plenty of knowledge and experience about handling estimation meetings without physical presence in the same room. But what to do when your team is outsourced and scattered among different time zones, so there is no opportunity for everyone to meet online?The most common solution (or at least such is my impression) is to ask participants to write their estimates in the comments of your issue tracker, per issue. While it might work, there is a few disadvantages to such approach:there is no "centralised" place for estimation resultsissues become "dirty" really fastSo I decided to take this "dirty" part out of the Issue Comments and move this functionality into an add-on. 
 6.8 billion cell-phones are used today. Phones were created to send and receive calls => making people able to talk to each other from distance. But Mute people can't use this important feature. They can SMS, but It's a very slow process. There are more than 6,000,000 mute people in the world, so we got an idea that could help them use this important feature. We searched for similar ideas but couldn't find one, so that encouraged us even more to build it. 
 Internet of Things primarily makes granular information more accessible in real time. However for ioT to take off, we need to show case the technology within a business scenario that can generate a multi-fold return on investment, so that the technology adoption can take off. Business CaseInformation availability in real time alone doesn't add value, or may not add sufficient value to justify the costs and risks associated with an ioT project. To get around this we researched industries and where a combination of an innovative business model that could be executed only through the availability of real time granular data.We looked around for business situations where the availability of granular information can add substantial value. We found that in the after-market automotive care. We further narrowed down the industry to only large trucks and only one part of the truck which is the tire. Tire manufacturers carry very high levels of tire inventory and so does the channel. We analyzed a few companies and found that the inventory holding was in billions. A good example was Good year Tires which had 10.5 Billion sales with over 2.6 Billion in finished goods inventory. The past three years were in the 2.4 to 2.6 billion range as well. The cost of holding inventory in this industry seemed to be between 40% - 55% according to our analysis. This meant that the carrying cost was over a billion dollars and cutting even a small percentage of the inventory will translate into a multi-million dollar cost savings. We created a business model that is based on usage inspired by Amazon Web services. AWS has allowed businesses to pay for IT infrastructure based on their usage. We realized that we could replicate this for a completely  different industry. When customers pay based on usage, their incentives are usually aligned with that of the Managed Service Provider.To align the incentives of the Fleet managers with the managed service provider, we created a usage based billing model for Fleet management. While initially the model will be a simple cents per mile model, more complex measures could be derived that would provide an incentive to the managed services provider to continue lowering the running cost per mile of a truck as long as they get a share of the cost reduction. Solution ArchitectureThe AWS solution architecture is shown below  Business NameHermes is the greek god for roadways and is also considered to be associated with Merchants and Luck. We therefore named the business  Hermes Managed Tire Services  Aligning IncentivesThe Fleet Owner or customer wants to maximize the miles and uptime on his trucks as they are a proxy for his revenue. The managed services provider also has the same metric thus aligning the incentives of the supplier and customer.What it takes to Manage a fleetManaging a fleet of trucks means minimizing the downtime, optimizing the fuel efficiency both of which depend a lot on tires. The business model we are proposing is inspired by the Amazon Web Services but to revolutionize the fleet management and make it a mileage based pricing instead of pricing it based on tires or specific parts.A fleet management operation wouldn't worry about what the condition of tires are and will pay the managed services company on miles traveled.  
  
 Our inspiration coms from the fact that we were students in a new city, which we wanted to explore but there seemed no application which would help us explore locally. All applications were geared towards planning long trips, there existed nothing to help us plan an exciting day to take in the local attractions. To fill this need, we decided to come up with an idea which helps users explore more intelligently and easily.

 Sitting in a 400 person lecture sucks. There is no ability to create consensus as to which parts of the lecture make sense and which don't. And this again and again leads to presenters lacking the audience feedback they need to deliver an engaging presentation. We wanted to provide presenters with an "at a glance" view of how many people couldn't understand the concept, or couldn't hear, or just like the presenter's hair today. A quick way to gain consensus information over time in a large audience, while keeping the audience engaged, Better presentations for everyone!!!

 The increasing number of suicides and depressed people has become a major cause of concern. Being able to identify such individuals and help them out before it is too late would be valuable. Previous research did not focus on the cause of mental illness.

 When we started off, we had an idea of what we want to do. We wanted to create a certain system to help the people in overcoming water crisis that prevails in California. In order to do so, we started our research on IOT and certain sensors which could help us to build this system. Though our idea was raw, what we required is a direction to go ahead with. This direction was showed to us by Mr Pramod Joshi, CEO of Winning Mantra. We are highly grateful to his valuable suggestions during the course of our project. 
  
 I started this app by first analyzing the Hsuehshan Tunnel Traffic datasets and OpenXc Datasets and uploading it to the server via json call.Since the traffic dataset provided were collected every 5 minutes(300 seconds). Our app makes call to the dataset json fileevery five minutes to  provide users with the most current traffic information's at any given time.Every User in Yilan and Taipei can be able to access the most current real time traffic information from home, offices, schools, church etc and could be able to know if there is traffic or not.Traffic RealTime Analysis every 5 MinutesThe app was able to predict and analysis every 5 minutes(300 seconds):1.) The status of traffic on the tunnel. The value of Zero(0) and Green light bulb indicates free network flow or no traffic2.) The app shows the number of lanes occupied every 5 minutes. for instance increased in the number of lanes occupied is an indication of slow movements which may be caused by traffic and vice versa.3.) The apps also show the volume of cars, Trains, long vehicles(Lorry) that transit the tunnel every 5 minutes.4.) The app works in conjuction with openXc dataset in analyzing the speed of every vehicle transiting the tunnel.The value of  the Vehicle speed  obtained from the Hsuehshan Tunnel Traffic datasets and OpenXc Datasets were also used in analyzing the trafficsituation of the tunnels as increase in the values of the vehicle speed indicates free flow of road network.Statistical Graphs RealTime Traffic AnalysisTo make this app one of the best in the world, those dataset leverages were dynamically coded to generate statistical graph Charts for Data Visualisations. For instnce from the graph, the user can be able to view the number of Cars, Trains, Longvehicles that transit the tunnel every 5 minutes. User can be able to see number of lane occupied,vehicle speeds overtime.Vehicle Performance Tunning and Monitoring via OpenxcOpenxc were also used to enable users to visualize the workability of his car system for performance and monitoring.car variables like Intake Manifold Pressure(Unit expressed in Pascal),Vehicle speed,Engine load,Engine speed,Enginecoolant Temperature along with their respective Timestamp were leveraged. This inputted variables were dynamically created and simulatedto provide the car owner with data visualisation on the workability of his entire car system.For instance, the value obtained from the engine load will tell the performance of the engine as the value is expressed in Horse Power(HP). With OpenXc, vehicle monitoring and performance overtime has been easier than ever.OpenXc Timestamp values were converted to Hours-Minutes-Seconds to make time data readable.For openXC only: Remember to Click on Reload Button after inputing and  submiting the OpenXc Car variables eg engine load, Intake manifold Pressure etc so as to reflect on the graphfor OpenXc Car Performance Monitoring and Data Visualisations.....Thank YouBuilt Withhsuehshan-tunnel-traffic-datasetsopenxcTry it outfredcare.com      Submitted to    Hsuehshan Tunnel Transformer    Created by  deleted deleted 
 Every year, there’s a huge monetary and personal loss to humanity, because of car crashes. So, when we heard about the hackathon, about the amount of data provided by VDOT and Smarter Roads, we as Computer Science students knew it right away, that we can contribute to this cause and decided to come up with a Machine Learning model to predict the number and the type of crashes.

 Many artists, professional or amateur, struggle with getting their ideas to the public. Innovative technology such as virtual reality (VR) brings a new set of options to these artists, making the opportunities to express themselves limitless. With VR, the artist’s room becomes his or her canvas where the artist can explore his or her ideas boundless. VR revolutionizes how the artist creates and sees his or her artwork and allows he or she to be himself or herself, respectively.The goal of this project was to develop a VR painting app that creates a comfortable, calming environment to create artwork and improves the quality of life of the user. Specifically, the app targets users who like to draw by improving current technology available to the users. The app includes features such as a 360˚ canvas, an extended color palette and brush selection with activation by a controller, and the option of undoing strokes. The app supports the idea of VR painting by also giving artists who have limited mobility the chance to create works of art once again. VR is a medium where there is an equal chance for all kinds of artists to create art. It is an environment where users can explore their creativity and imagination. This app is designed to give a chance to all who dare to try it.

 Last summer, at Make School Summer Academy, I was pondering what App I wanted to bring into the world. After many days of deliberation, I found the answer in my day-to-day routine. Almost everyday, I would be texting or calling my best friends, and I realized that I only really kept in touch with a few of my real-life friends. Thus, Touch was born: a way to constantly connect with all contacts. 
 We were thinking of having the proper analysis of a product in systematic and product driven way.We went across which datasets to choose from as our idea was to choose the best proper solution hence the project started 
 Hsuehshan Tunnel is the best road for connecting Taipei and Yilan. However there is always traffic jams which increases the driving time on holidays. This proposal focus on eliminating the factor of traffic jam to solve the problem. From our experience of getting stuck in traffic jam, the car speed is usually slow when entering a tunnel, and gets higher and higher when approaching the exit. Why?  There are three main reasons we have concluded as follow: People can’t always keep driving at the same high speed because of the difference speed information showing on the dashboard between different cars. People have difference concepts of safe distance for driving. Improper brake slows down the car speed behind and causes the chain reaction.That is, if all the drivers can drive at the best speed with a suitable safe distance, the rate of traffic flow in tunnel can be higher. As a result, how to guide drivers respectively to drive at the best speed with an appropriate distance is the main purpose of the proposal.雪山隧道是目前台北與宜蘭往返中，最便捷安全的路線。然而，此路線在假日常常造成堵塞的問題，使得行車時間大為增加。本提案提出一種可行且有效率的方式，根除造成堵塞的因素，解決雪山隧道塞車的問題。從我們自身的塞車經驗觀察到，通常進入雪山隧道時的車速很慢，但漸漸靠近出口時，速度越來越通順。探究其主要原因，是車輛沒有保持最高速度前進、或者不當的剎車動作，造成後方連鎖反應。因此，如能讓所有車輛在安全前提之下，能保持最佳的前進速度，隧道的車流量可以達到最理想的狀況。然而，最困難之處在於每輛車儀表顯示的車速會有落差，加上每位駕駛主觀認為的安全車距皆不同，因此如何導引每位駕駛至最佳的"車速"與"車距"，是本提案最主要的目標。 
 My friends and I have lots of painful experience of going through traffic jam in Hsuehshan Tunnel. Therefore, we wanted to think of a solution that can at least relief the suffering of the driver and the passenger in jam or a way to reduce the traffic.

 We have worked lot for e-commerce clients here in India. The biggest challenge which we have faced is when our client is asked for single communication channel platform which can broadcast in multiple ways. They are not asking this only for transactional communication but also for marketing purpose. But we do not have any solution of this query for them. To full-fill those requirements we have to integrate different things for different channel. Which takes a lot time to implementation as well as it is very complex to maintain.Here we got to know about "Whispir". And after looking into that we founded that can be very useful to our clients. And from here we got into the development processes.Right now we have development a sample Android application which can be used to delivery SMS, Emails and do a Voice Call. It can also save Contacts and can create work-spaces.We are writing the code in such a way that it can easily integrated with any-other android application and also can be utilized based on different scenarios.We have can created it to showcase functionality of Whispir to our clients. 
 As members of the Montreal Startup ecosystem and newly members of the hacker community, we have been to a lot of events like startup weekends, conferences, and have been confronted to the inconvenience of having to configure WiFi access with complicated and/or long passwords. So we wanted to come up with a solution to make the experience of connecting to a WiFi hotspot less tedious, hassle-free, and more automated. 
  
 Many organisations use HP tools such as HP ALM (Application Lifecycle Management / Quality Center) for test management and HP Quick Test Professional for test automation. However, most of the customers who migrate to JIRA, leaves HP ALM (Application Lifecycle Management / Quality Center) Test Sets automated with Quick Test Professional running out of Continuous Integration setup.  Although it is possible to integrate them with continuous integration tools, the complexity to make it work, reliability and end results are never satisfactory. 
 If you've ever hit the snooze button again and again and again only to realize hours later that you should have been up long ago, then you've felt the pain that we have felt. Driven by the need for an alarm that genuinely got us up, we set out to create wake. The app itself is simple. Instead of tapping or sliding a button to disable it, the user must get out of bed and walk a certain distance away to disable the alarm or vigorously shake the alarm for twenty-seconds. These physical triggers engage the user in a way that alarms have not done in the past. Leveraging the GPS and Accelerometer features of modern smartphones we created wake. Additionally, typical snooze features enable users to form bad habits by continuously snoozing an alarm. Instead, wake provides a unique form of negative reinforcement. Users can choose to enable or disable the snooze feature, but there's a catch. The snooze feature must be linked to the user's bank account, and every snooze donates a pre-set amount of money to an entity of the user's choice, such as a charity or political campaign.How we built itThe application was built in Objective-C for iOS devices. We leveraged iOS’s NotificationCenter, AudioToolbox, AVFoundation, CoreLocation, and CoreMotion frameworks to implement all the features for this application. We integrated Plaid’s API for payment processing.Challenges we ran intoDue to some of iOS’s restrictions, setting the alarm to trigger at a certain time and forcing the user to only use the app was technically impossible. So we could only display a notification for the user to open the app in order to disable the alarm. Additionally, the UILocalNotifications that we used for the event triggers were uncooperative and sometimes would not fire — so we also built a standard timer to alleviate this issue.Unfortunately, due to the lack of an Objective-C wrapper/library for Plaid, we were unable to complete integrating their payment processing system.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe were proud of the UI animations, flow, and functionality of the app. We wanted to make the app not only be functional but also to look/feel great. (Watch the video demo! (Some interactions shortened for brevity.))What we learnedWe learned that making a alarm application was not as simple as we thought and that working with AutoLayout (through code) could be very painful at times.What's next for wakeWe will attempt to finish integrating the Plaid payment processing system and releasing wake to the app store.Built Withobjective-csketchTry it outgetwakeapp.com      Submitted to    SpartaHack 2016Winner                Best iOS App              Winner                Top 10                  Created by  Alexander ChangJust a kid with a computer.Thomas CI write code... and sometimes it works! 
 In the past, when working on high volume imports in Neo4j, we had to create custom procedures and test their performance using CSV input data.We tried to achieve this using Gatling with the Bolt extension, but for some reason, it was not playing well with CSV input files.As JMeter is also a very popular tool, we created our load tests with it and it worked very well. But these tests were a bit cumbersome to write because (unlike JDBC, JMS, ...),  there is no native bolt protocol support in Jmeter. We had to do a lot of manual scripting.

 As an IT Scientist, I have little knowledge on Agriculture based on Agric Science I did in Secondary School but thisknowledge wasn't enough so I started interviewing Farmers,Agricultural Lecturers and Students within my area and In my school on what to do to ensure excellent farming, maximum crop yield and to ensure thatall this information are passed from one generation of Farmer to another without alteration. The average resopnse I got were stated below.1.) If appropriate planning are in place regarding financial Capabilities,production cost,crops yields things will be okay.2.) Testing of soil propertises need to be done to know the crop suitable for a particular Areas.3.) The major problems faced by farmers are mostly drought, weeds and Insect Attacks. If this can be mitigated, then maximum yield can be expected.4.) Most Young Agricultural graduates and Farmers lack interest in Farming because of unavailability of Informations onModern trends in Agriculture. All Professors and all Agricultural Students and graduates in various Universities Points out that If USDA Dataset can be collabrated with Social Network for purpose of Dataset Analysis, Data Visualisation,information Exchange(Just like in Facebook),it will make farming/Agricultural Studies one of the most interesting disciplinein the world. For Instance a Young Graduate trying to setup a Soyabeans Farming can immediately leverage USDA Datasets andcan share his knowledge, ideas or issues with other Users(Farmers) via a social network thus ensuring information propagationthrough an unbroken succession from one generation of Farmer to another. Farmers are ensured that any issues on farming can easily be resolved by leveraging USDA Dataset and by other responses from Farmers from various Farming disciplines within the Social Network.What Inspiration & Interview Lands me into.USDA Dataset is Very Broad though the API Call for each dataset is very simple. Thanks for the USDA Enginneers.From Inspiration above, we all knew that Water(H2O) and Air(O2) are two essential commodities that support human lives.While Human uses Oxygen(O2), plant uses Carbondioxide(CO2) for Photosythesis as can  be expressed mathematically inthe Photosynthetic Equation BelowFrom the Photosynthetic Equation Above, You can Visualize the quantity of Water and Carbon(iv)Oxide needed as a reactant toyield a Product called Sugar.So from this equation, you can understand that water is very essential for plants growths andcrops yield. Consequently, lack of water commonly known as DROUGHT can be disasterous to plants as it can inhibitsphotosynthesis in plants and can lead to little or no crop yield or the plant may even die off due to lack of water.What I builtAn app that allows American Farmers to visualized their idea crops,predicts production cost, knows the favourable state for growing a particullar crop, visualized the amount of water needed(eg. Irrigated Water,Ground Water, Surface Water) and quantity of crops yields in Bushels over time.The app also allows information exchange between Farmers via a social network. The App leverages Irrigation Technology & Water Use (ARMS DATASET 1999-2006).What this App DoesComponents A: USDA Data VisualisationsThe App leverages Irrigation Technology & Water Use (ARMS DATASET 1999-2006). From the USDA Dataset above, we picked uptwo crops (Soyabeans and Corn) so we started with Soyabeans as a case study via the API Call.so the app were able to integrate all Planted Acres, Irrigated Acres, the ground water usage, surface water usage and irrigated water used on the crop(Soyabeans) and amount of products yields(Bushels) per application over time(eg 2006,2002,2000,1999 etc..). This datasets were collected for every statesin United States. All this datasets were dynamically created via API Call to deploy Data Visualization components and statistical graphs were ploted using Bar Charts, Column Charts,Aggregated Area Chart and Pie Chart distribution Analysis over time.With this Graphs Visualization Components, Farmers can be able to Visualized graphs Dataset on each states in USA on crops Yields(eg.Soyabeans) over time(eg year 2006,2002,2000,1999 etc)For instance in Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska etc........Farmer can graphically visualize over time,A.) Amount of surface water used vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel)B.) Amount of Ground Water Used vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel)C.) Amount of Irrigated Water Applied  vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel)D.) Amount of planted Acres etc...From this graph Visualisation statistical Analysis, Farmer can be able to know the quantity of water(Eg.Ground,Surface,Irrigated)needed and amount of crops that can be produce with it with respect to time(Eg. year 2006,2002,2000,1999).For instance in Nebraska state in the year 2006, the average Arms Datasets were as followsGround Water Used: 90.472 Percent of Irrigated Acres.Surface Water Used: 9.528 Percent of Irrigated Acres.Water Used Per Irrigated Acres: 9.715 Per Inches.Irrigated Acres: 2369.147 Per 1,000 Acres.Planted Acres: 5050.109 Per 1,000 Acres.Crop Yield Per Irrgated Acres: 61.98 Pounds(cotton), Bushels(all other crops).All this statistical Data will help Farmers in decision making process like checking production cost, crops yield and Business Profitability The app also provides Dataset Graphs Visualisation Components that allows Farmers to Compare and visualize data at State Levelonthe amount of planted Acres per state, the amount of Water needed(Eg Irrigated, Surface and Ground Water) versus Crop Yield etc per state.This will help USA Farmers to know the States that consumes more water and amount of crop yields(eg. Soyabeans).For instance, graphs data visualisation on state level comparison eg in year 2006, shows that INDIANA consumes highest Groundwater(about 100.00 percent of irrigated acres and crop yields was 40.561 Bushels) whileNEBRASKA consumes lesser Groundwater(90.472 percent of irrigated acres and yield the highest crop in the year about61.98 Bushels)Based on Production Cost,You can see that Nebraska in the year 2006(ARMS DataSets) consumes lesser water and produces thehighest Crop Yields(Eg. Soyabeans) than its counter part state Indiana that consumes the highest water in the same year but produces a lesser Crop Yields.The Inference from this Arms dataset 2006 makes Nebraska one of the best state in USA suitable for Soyabeans Farming both in production cost and crop Yields.Components B: Social Network Integration with 1-to-1 Chat System with Photo Sharing OptionMy Interview with Farmers, Professors and all Agriculttural Students and graduates in various UniversitiesPoints out that If USDA Dataset can be collabrated with Social Network for purpose of Dataset Analysis, Data Visualisation,information Exchange(Just like in Facebook),it will make farming/Agricultural Studies one of the most interesting disciplinein the world. For Instance a Young Graduate trying to setup a Soyabeans Farming can immediately leverage USDA Datasets andcan share his knowledge, ideas or issues with other Users(Farmers) via a social network thus ensuring information propagationthrough an unbroken succession from one generation of Farmer to another. This Social Integration are design to function just like facebook.it will help farmers exchange informations between themselves. Farmers, Agriculturist can be able to Share and post status updates, post photos, post and Share Videos, send like & comments etc. about Agricultural modern trends and for educative puposes. Farmers can be able to send friend request to their fellow Farmers, Makes friends and chat with one another on 1-to-1 chat conversationswith photo sharing options. Users can be able to search Farmers based on their names,email address, phone number and Farmersfarming specialization. For instance if you are looking for a farmer that speacialized on Corn Farming to have a conversationwith him or her, you can just type corn in the search box and all farmers that specialized on corn farming will bepopulated.....If you know how to use facebook, this social integration will be easy for you as everything were implemented using facebookliketechnology and user friendly UI designs.How it WorksJust call up the application and make one time registration. Login to start accessing the app.To visualize USDA Datasets, click on AGRO PRODUCT, select soyabeans as a case study and then navigate. On the landingpage, you can be able to access the USDA Datasets on different states overtime eg(year 2006,2002,2000,1999), If the states you are looking for is  not loaded,Click on LOAD MORE US STATE button to load more state.Every Populated states immediately shows average Planted Acres, ground water used,surface water used, irrigated water appliedand amount of crop yield over time.To be able to visualize datasets statistics of a particular state eg ARKANSAS,NEBRASKA etc... you can click onClick on View State StatisticsTo be able to compare datasets statistics for all states at state level, click on Compare All States flanking each state.Once you are there first select the year eg (2006,2002,2000,1999) that you want to compare and visualized, and the graphsdata will be loaded for each year choosen. For further details reference the demonstration video or email me.For Social integration, everybody is already facebook fans, so just assume yourself to be accessing facebooks where you canpost Status Updates, Post Photos, Post and Share Videos on Farming and Agro-Educations. Can Send Friend request, Makes friends,Like and Comments on every post being Shared, can search and connect to any Farmer in United States. Among all can be ableto Chat with other Farmers in United States on 1-to-1 chat messages with photo sharing option..Challenges I facedSome Datasets has null values when making API Call to USDA ARMS DATASETs. NUll simply means that the value in Undetermined,unknown or Not available. I implore a module on my server backend that converts all null values in the API to zero to make statistical analysis more efficient.Again Building a Social Network with Facebook design with all techonogical components and features to make the app userfriendly and integrating it with USDA DATASETS for Data Analysis and Visualization took much of my time to be precise(32 days)What NextWe will adding other remaining crops and its datasets one after the other via the API call and allows data Visualisation on the fly while ensuringthat all datasets are in place.we need to expand social aspect of the Apps to allow farmers to start creating Farmers Groups, Farmers Page just likein facebook. Eg A farmer can create a group on titled "Rice Farming" and other farmers who are interested on Rice farming canfollow up.Comming SoonAndroid Version in less than 14 days.

 The way I think the web app is all about usage of Open Data portal.I have never used Open Data for any Challenge our API's for it.So my first motto was to get a firm grip on API usages and ways of using it.I started exploring the details in internet and got myself going.Most importantly I used details from the Kontakt.io website about Beacons and then started using it.I also had in my mind to use the transit data api and hence explored and did it to my liking. 
 The web is just toxic because you and I can be toxic. The Problem of InternetEveryone hates that the internet can be really mean. Everyone hates the cyberbullies, the keyboard warriors, the irrational haters that contribute to this issue. Yet, everyone can easily become a bully, a hater, a keyboard warrior because people may get angry and act on anger without thinking twice. Hence, everyone is in this vicious cycle of internet toxicity. Creating it, spreading it and hating it all at the same time. As a conclusion, the internet needs to have a sort of measurement, that could not only think twice for us but also help us to think twice. We need a “frenly™” internet.Solutionfrenly™ is a Chrome extension that vows to end the vicious cycle of internet toxicity in the web, by proactively preventing toxicity from spreading and creating. Features as below:1. Read Post / CommentsWhen our backend sentiment analysis engine detects potentially toxic comments in the loaded web page, they will be censored by an overlaying color block. The user may choose to reveal the negative comment at his/her risk.If the page contains too many negative comments, we will request the user to consider to leave the page.By smartly detecting the web content, user can be in a more active position countering internet toxicity. Whatever is spread, can no longer harm. 2. Write Post / CommentsWe introduce a toxicity meter on the comment textbox. Before a comment is being posted, it is sent to our backend sentiment analysis engine to evaluate its polarity.If the polarity goes too negative, the system will pop a window to advise the user to reconsider his/her word choices.By initiating respectful reminding alerts, user can no longer fall easily for the emotional trap. Whatever is toxic, can no longer be created. 3. Post / Comment Wrap-UpA health check summary is provided to the user to assess his/her average negativity and subjectivity of input history.Implementation wise, we pull the active user's comments and posts using Facebook API and Twitter API and feed them into our sentiment analysis engine for evaluation.Tokenization is performed on the user's comments and posts to find out the top 5 most significant words used in each social media platform.By actively studying user’s internet speech, user can learn more about him/herself and cultivate the right mindset.Together with all 3 aspects, we hope to create a lightweight, yet powerful tool to help to build a nicer, friendlier web community.What's Next For frenly™frenly™ is now supported to run on Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. We hope that it could be extended on other social media platforms to continue its effort on combating cyber negativity.frenly™'s backend sentiment analysis engine could be improved to achieve more precise detection on negative and potentially harmful comments.TeamTan Hao HaoGary Lai Jun HongHeng Ming JiBuilt Withcsshtmljavascriptnatural-language-processingpythonsentiment-analysis-onlineTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    Hack&Roll 2019Winner                Top 8                  Created by  Heng Ming JiTan Hao HaoFinal Year Computer Science Student @ NTUGary Lai

 Many people suffer from the habit of procrastination which results in them falling behind and losing control of time. They aim to accomplish so much in such little time but fall short in doing so. This problem of procrastination is growing as serious rates, likely due to the introduction of new and improved distractions that are even harder to ignore. In fact, according to Dr. Steel, Phd, a physiologist at the University of Calgary, the population suffering from chronic procrastination increased from 5% to 26% between 1978 and 2007. Also, in a different meta-analysis experiment, Steel found that 80-95% of 2007 college students admitted to procrastination that negatively affected their classwork.

Parents can set Purrpurino's emotions, and Purrpurino will act depending of that state. For example if the toy is sick it will expect a kid to take care of him, and if it is playful it will expect the kid to play with him. · It would help kids sleep at night, with dim lights that will keep company and help them stop being afraid of the dark! · A system to help parents waking up their kids, gradually increasing Purrpurino's led brightness in the morning and using the stepper motor to make the kid wake up with a smile.Purrpurino comes from a combination of different words - Purpurina (Spanish word for glitter), "Purr" (like the purring of cats) and the suffix -ino obviously comes from Arduino.  
 Every day, time was wasted on roads at intersections because of the unreasonable distribution of duration of green lights. If the roads with more cars can have longer durations of green lights, people's time can be saved. 
 70% of Cardiac Arrest happens outside of the hospital. The first few minutes are critical to organ function - it is imperative that the patient receives immediate assistance, which can mean the difference between life and death. We believe everyone in the world deserves access to the best CPR education available. Effective CPR can double the chances of survival and preserve vital brain function. 
  
 Since publishing educational guides about popular DeFi tools (DeFiTutorials.com) and observing early-users’ simulations on DeFi Strategies, we were inspired to create an easy way for anyone (no matter how much they know about using each DeFi tool) to get instant access to multiple DeFi protocols. Right now, DeFi is just a buzzword to most people. We even noticed someone taking advantage of the DeFi community's current traction. They set up "DeFi" tokens to make gains through the unawareness of other people who believe 'DeFi' is an asset they can invest in through these tokens. People see ETH locked in DeFi going up and think, “How can I get exposure to that growth?!” We are putting education at the core of our approach to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone. 
 We wanted to make a fully functional multiplayer game. 
 As of 2013, there are roughly 38 million Americans who have experienced severe hearing loss. Shockingly, only 7.6 million of them could actually benefit from wearing a hearing aid. We wanted to create a world in which they are capable of seeing what we hear, providing near real-time speech-to-text translation. This is one of the practical uses of AR where it actually augments their world by helping them understand others with such ease.  
  
 Nowadays, security is only as good as you make it.  The PDFs we have today can be signed by just about anyone without any real sort of evidence that they were in fact the person who signed it.  How can we really know if documents were signed by Joseph Song or Cassidy Williams?  With Sincerely, we're able to train signature models to be able to accurately and verifiably predict whether it was the person who signed it or not.   
 Being in a fast paced and working society, many working adults choose to take away food to be consumed at home or at their office, rather than cook their own meals to save time. The idea our team came up with is to allow these people who take away food a chance to earn some money while going through their usual routine.

 We believe that the impact of ideas is the foundation on which we should build our world on. Our team was inspired to take on a challenge that would improve the lives of those around us while remaining true to our roots. When the Fort McMurray fires of 2016 destroyed over 3244 homes and caused 9.9 billion USD in damages, the lives of our team members were transformed. Coming from Alberta, the effects of the fire left a lasting impression on our views of how technology can be used for good and helped us discover a newfound sense of purpose. We sought to use new and novel technologies to make this a reality. Guardian is a novel helmet designed to advance current firefighting methods. By attaching various crucial sensors on the helmet, we are able to gather important vitals about the environment such as temperature, CO2 levels, atmospheric pressure, volume of total organic compounds, and much more while simultaneously sending this data in real-time over the Internet of Things platform to a remote database. We then retrieved this information and created a unique web user interface that responded to the real-time changes in data to relay information across all individuals over watching the situation.  
 Many successful startups like Product Hunt choose to build their product in public, roping in their user community. The transparency and sense of participation is crucial in building an engaged community of early adopters.We're building a service called Hello Money by actively inviting Redditors to discuss our product and submit feature requests via AMA and comments. We want to take this approach further and really opt our users in our development process.Engaging the community in development process is something that Meteor Development Group is also trying to improve, so we also hope this project can also serve as an inspiration for how Meteor can become more open and interactive. 
 Today we have hundreds of applications in Android to show the map from one place to another. The technology is becoming much more and more  sophisticated but it never show us what the condition of road is currently which mostly causes us a lot of problems. Ambulances, took patients in such hurry and they also had to take care of the patients health. A serious jump can cause a patient some severe injuries. Thinking about all of this we thought why not an application, that not only will show the map but will also describe the condition of the road. 
 The inspiration for this application came from using text to speech software that can return a somewhat intelligent reply. Once the format is set, any json used as the dictionary that the software draws from can be modified to suit anyone's needs. Therefore, while this application is a gag application, the source code can be modified such that it can be used for counselling, problem solving, or any other purpose where automated interaction would be useful.  
 IT Support team using Nagios for monitoring & Atlassian toolset for ticketing needs to keep track of Nagios incidents from Nagios Dashboard and Other helpdesk requests through Jira or Service Desk.

 As thousands of organizations use both DocuSign and Confluence for business critical e-signature documents, we identified a need to create an integration between both platforms to improve approval processes. By filling a market need across a multitude of business use cases (such as companies requiring HIPAA, FDA, and SOX compliance, to name a few), DocuSign for Confluence eliminates wasted time and tightens the feedback loop of the e-signature process while ensuring compliance regulations for these users. 
 The Roomba and Pokemon Go. We wanted to combine the idea of an autonomous robot that collects trash (humans are better for this) and the fun of an augmented reality game to utilize gamification strategies in a socially beneficial manner. 
 I used Trello to track my development projects. At some point, I realized I was doing a lot of repetitive actions, and decided to look into solving it.I created a simple bot that would allow you to do a few Trello things automatically, and made an announcement in the Trello subreddit. It had a very positive reception, which made me think there was a need to be covered.But the bot wasn't integrated in Trello and it was hard to use. So I decided early on that I would write a Power-Up, but it took me a long time to figure out how to fit automation into the Trello UI. Eventually, it clicked: the Power-Up experience is all about integrating fully with the UI, and one of the most powerful capabilities that Power-Ups allow is the integration of custom buttons in the UI.So, using the experience learned on the bot, I built the Power-Up relatively quickly, and we finally launched it in June 12th this year with very good feedback. 
 So much of a team's knowledge goes into Confluence, but it can be hard to find later, especially if you didn't write the original page. We saw an opportunity to make that knowledge much more useful by building search that's super-fast and a little personalised.

 When a child surgery is taking place, parent and children anxiety has been detected as a crucial point.Giving updated information is essential to allow parents to have feedback of the status of the surgery, and usually this process takes crucial time from caregivers. Besides that, children are often scared and nervous in the anesthesiology and operation processes. 
  
  
 We have built Travel Ride bid Bot. Bidding travel ride is one of the crucial aspect in travel or cab industry. 
 We wanted to follow the theme of the jam, “Resurrection”, but we wanted to be unconventional. Respawning was the first idea, but it was also something that anybody could think of. We thought we could do better.The first ideas went towards procedural generation. Resurrect as something different every time, maybe. But that would have just been a regular rogue-like.Then we thought about the elements of the game. We brainstormed and came up with the conclusion that characters and settings are a big part of what makes a game a GOOD game.What character can we associate to resurrection? And we thought: the Phoenix! And what settings can we associate with it? An endless fly towards the sun, to be able to resurrect from its own ashes. Ockham’s Razor. It’s so simple, yet so special. Simple characters, simple game mechanics. All of it wrapped in a beautiful environment and a fly towards what cannot be reached by mortals. Modern Daedalus and Icarus.

 The cryptocurrency market saw a dramatic fallout throughout 2018. With Bitcoin falling from a value of $17,000 per coin in January of 2018 to around $3,500, many traders incurred losses since the start of the year.Whether you are a trader or an investor, your objective is to make money. Your secondary objective is to do so with the minimum acceptable level of risk.Now Derivatives are financial instruments that aim to increase returns and reduce risk. A Derivative is a financial instrument that derives its value from an underlying asset, in this case, cryptocurrencies. An Option is a contract that gives an investor the right — but not the obligation — to buy/sell an asset at a certain price within a certain period of time.The idea behind ETHOptions is to introduce options contracts over the blockchain, for traders to hedge against their crypto investments beyond Bitcoin. Bitcoin Options do exist, however as the market share of ERC20 tokens have grown to 91% due to the daily trading volumes and number of projects existing on the Ethereum Blockchain, Options contract for ERC20 tokens will have a huge market outreach.All the major crypto players are getting into Bitcoin derivatives. Whereas, derivatives for Ethereum based tokens is still an untouched market.We’re providing a new Crypto Asset class that can potentially have a market size of $42 Billion. 
 As Singapore is a multi-racial country with many different people of different races and religion are living in Singapore, all of us will have our different dietary needs. If we were to prepare certain food for our guests, we need to know what they prefer or what they cannot eat. Some of us are vegetarian, while some of us prefer local food. Thus we create this application to allow people to know whether the food that they are cooking will be suitable for their guests. Also, it allows people to interconnect by knowing the different type of food available around the world, with people enjoying the food cooked suited to their preferences.

 Have you ever complained about the weather in your location, had some time off booked and money to spend, but did not know where to go?If the answer is yes, then you would really do with My Perfect Weather app.Just to illustrate how the app could be used, here are some use cases:You have a child that you promised to fly a kite this week, but it's absolutely windless where you live and you don't want to break your word.You live in a windy and rainy place like I do (Edinburgh, Scotland) and want to feel warmth on your skin and definitely NO rain.You have an urge to build a snowman and you won't rest until you fulfil it.You want to go fishing, and this time, you really want to catch something.Last time, you spent 5 days looking for a place with good weather for your 3-day cycling trip and you want to make the decision faster this time. 
 At my house, a couple phrases are sure to be uttered throughout the day: “Did someone let the dog out this morning?” or “Did someone feed the dog her dinner?”Our dog, Joy, has accidentally been fed twice many times because of miscommunication between us, her caretakers. This very common problem for pet owners inspired me to develop DogLog, an app that aims to close the communication gap for families with pets. 
 Questions related to pregnancy are very common and since this subject is bounded, we had the idea to organize it as a chat bot making it easy to interact with pregnant Women. 
 Team member Alex Tran received free and reduced lunch as a young student.

We on Team Lunchbox want to make it easier for all people who could qualify for free and reduced lunch to apply for the the program in a way that’s simple and not intimidating so that their kids have the best opportunity to learn.  
  
  
 The 21st century ushered with it the age of smart and predictive technology with the optimum use of resources to make life easier and take preventive measures against predicted mishaps. In accordance with this trend, the proposal is an automated (SAE level 5) mode of transport using a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm with concepts of Ant Colony Optimization, big data analytics and cloud computing for number crunching to arrive at the destination based on the traffic and the number of drivers on the road, in the shortest time possible instead of the usual shortest distance algorithms. The analysis of the time saved by the drivers for different map types is recorded and compared and the results are found to be more efficient with respect to time as compared to the time taken by the original Dijkstra’s algorithm. 
  
 One early Wednesday morning, I woke up excitedly to read a new chapter on One Piece. However, there was no translated text yet. With anger, frustration, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, we decided to start this project to prevent this from happening again.

 This is a challenge proposed by Vodafone. According to them, 80% of the customers look for a new phone online, and already know what they want by the time they hit the stores. The only reason why the customer does not buy the phone directly from the site is that they want to get a feel for the phone, and how that compares to their current phone. 
 We're all huge fans of Guitar Hero but we're not musicians. So we created a real-time system that lets  you play any instrument and create the music you like! We made the system super intuitive and fun to play with. 
 What if you could take your IMVU avatar into the real world - have it hang out, literally, “in your hands.” What if you could take Instagram videos and photos (because it happened!) and share it to your IMVU feed? (Also, I needed live Instagram effects for another project.) 
 Many millennials struggle with managing their finances and answering important financial wellness questions regarding topics like taxes, student loans, credit and debit usage, and budgeting. As a team, we wanted to tackle a problem we all struggled with and knew many of our peers were struggling with. We wanted to provide educational information on financial well-being to players in a fun and engaging way. 
 Here is how I got the idea. I once forgot my laptop charger at the library in University. It took me 3 days to find it at the end, because there is no way to contact me, for a person who finds it. I could have written my name, mobile number and contact information on it, but it is embarrassing because every sees it. So I thought how can I solve this problem and are there any existing one. I could find that there isn't any existing solution. So I focused on it. What I need is something everybody can easily see, but cannot contact me or bug me throw it. I think it may look like a encryption problem too. I alway enjoyed compiling innovating solutions to problems, so I got a solution and here we are. 
  
  
 Ever stuck at the traffic when going to Yilan on a Friday evening or Saturday morning? Max capacity for cars to go through Hsueshan Tunnel is 2,400/hr and the average weekend car flow is 71,000 cars. There have been a wide range of discussions on how to tackle the issues from providing instant monitoring to leveraging the public transportation to reduce the total car flow. Are there any other options we can leverage to reduce some pains and time spent waiting on the road? Are there more efficient ways of managing the total car flow and optimizing the experiences of passengers in various purposes? 
 Software from nearly every single project in this hackathon is hosted all on the same open source site: GitHub. What if we could pay developers for publishing quality open source code? That's what CommitCoin does. Using cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, CommitCoin encourages open source development by paying those who decide to share their revolutionary code with the world. 
 We wanted to ensure women can be out on the streets at night with a confidence that she has her way out when a danger arises 
 The idea of the WatchTower add-on was a solution for our internal pain. Being an official Atlassian Solution Partner and Vendor, our team at Rozdoum works with multiple clients, each of them having their own JIRA and assigning tasks on us. We got tired of context switching and wanted fast and easy way to grasp the whole picture of issues from remote Cloud & Server locations in one board. We thought about developing the add-on to make our project manager’s work easier. So, here is a WatchTower - that saves time by allowing to work at one consolidated board to manipulate issues at remote JIRA instancesHere is a short how-to video Key featuresWorks on Cloud & Server, Can use Cloud and/or Server as source of issues for the boardFine tuning of pulled data based on JQLEasy mapping of issue statuses to board columnsEasy start in less than 5 minutesWork in one place - update remotely.

We followed that in other addons - we continued doing that with WatchTower. “Eat your own dog food” that’s the principle behind WatchTower. The essential requirement for WatchTower is proper handling of private data and security. Our add-on does not store any credentials for source JIRAs. On authorization it retrieves a token and uses it for further sending requests to remote JIRA instances. Challenges we ran intoSupport of all custom fields on issue transition screen. Sophisticated approach for each field type is necessary.

 There are existing Alexa apps for quiz, learning, etc. So we decided to build an app which will be used for education as well as a quiz game. Already there are mathematics and other quiz games. We decided to implement the game Rivers of the world. Here the user can ask Alexa the largest rivers in the world, its length, its location, etc. as well they can play quiz game of rivers. 
 While working with Scrum teams on a daily basis we wanted to put the fun back into agile estimation with slick, native mobile apps and a plugin for JIRA. Also, when developers join an estimation session we wanted to detach them from their laptops - to make the session more effective - while keeping the digital tech side of things - so they can certainly use their mobile phones for voting. 
 We wanted to improve the performance and efficiencies for Development Teams. We were looking to increase development performance by loading build status requests and trigger new builds, using a self-service setup. This led us to build a new Alexa Skill; We call it Build Meister. 
  
 News outlets today are quick to publish how modern AI is literally superhuman in most fields, driving systemic change in the way our societies and economies are organized. Despite its far-reaching impact, AI has never felt less accessible. It seems like somewhere in the process of beating Go, captioning our images, and driving autonomous vehicles, AI has paradoxically lost its human touch. We want to bring that connection back in a way that fosters creativity and recognizes the strengths of both man and machine. We believe that something as powerful as AI should have a soul and, most importantly, expand human souls.  We want to empower music producers, artists and enthusiasts, giving them access to an entire orchestra of artificial agents to compose, create and improvise music. Rather than using AI to replace human talent, we see this as a means to augment and supercharge existing human facilities and intuition, allowing human composers to reach creative heights that were never possible before, both through real-time improvisational cues and procedurally generated sonic compositions.  
 Playing with trains is fun. Coding with Meteor is also fun. So, why not control a toy train through the browser using Meteor?  
 Inspired by our teammate Ian's previous experience with sending text messages over an email server, we decided that it would be extremely useful to be able to do more with text messages.  In addition, it's often necessary to manage a server on the go, and given that text messages don't require a Wi-Fi connection, they're the perfect way to make sure that we could have access to our server 24/7. 
 Learning to use LaTeX is unnecessarily cumbersome, but it is still considered the de facto standard for publishing in many science, math, and engineering disciplines. Most LaTeX users either learn to write raw LaTeX code or use clunky GUI interfaces. TeXscribe aims to optimize the workflow of writing about math. 
 We wanted to change the way video games were played by exploring a new medium. We believe this is a unique solution to eye-strain for programmers and frequent computer users, and a unique story-telling method.

 Drinking water is becoming a very limited resource. Drought is one problem that some people are facing everyday and although it may not affect us today, it can do someday. Prevention is one of the keys to succeed when the problem arises and wanting to create something to help people, even if it only raises its awareness about the real problem, would be a great way to put my bit in helping society. The main idea would be to create a personal water footprint which we can check, share and improve.

 Through my consulting practice, Limbr, I help software and marketing teams become more efficient and more effective through the application of lean and agile methods. I implement the Atlassian Cloud stack (JIRA Software, Tempo Timesheets, Confluence, BitBucket, HipChat) for each of my clients, customized with a set of battle-tested conventions and configurations that I've honed over the last 5 years. While the setup works well overall, I have always found that the reporting capabilities left a little to be desired - far too frequently, a client asks me "how do I find out... ", and my best answer has been "run such and such JQL query, export the data to Excel, and manipulate the spreadsheet this way and that way". This works, but presents a real hassle for users for simple ad-hoc reporting needs.For example, say I want to know the average velocity of one of my Scrum teams over the past eight sprints. I could either run the Velocity Report included in JIRA Software and break out my calculator to manually sum and average the shipped Story Points, or I could run a JQL query to filter for the relevant issues, export to CSV, and add aggregation functions to the spreadsheet. Furthermore, I want to calculate this figure before every sprint planning session in order to inform the team's commitment for the upcoming sprint. What a pain!I thought there must be a better way, and searched for viable solutions in the Marketplace. Unfortunately, while there were several reporting and business intelligence add-ons available for JIRA Cloud, they were all predicated on exporting JIRA data to an external BI tool. These tools are no doubt powerful, however needing to leave JIRA to perform basic segmentation or aggregation was exactly what I wanted to avoid. Additionally, I needed a solution that was both accessible and intuitive to grasp for a wide range of JIRA users, which was at odds with the requirement of buying and learning a sophisticated external tool.Thus, Limbr Reports for JIRA Cloud was born.

 Tandem was built by a team of people obsessed with solving big problems in healthcare.  We were first inspired to tackle the problem of inefficient internal hospital communications last spring, when researching how existing communications systems lead to high patient length of stay, ambulance diversion, left-without-being-seen patients, and other key KPI's.  To get to the root of the problem, we partnered up with Dr. Alex Mohseni, the Chief Innovation Officer of Emergency Medicine Associates, spent over 100 hours over the summer observing, shadowing, and interviewing staff in every role in a hospital at Doctor's Community Hospital in Maryland.  At the end of the summer the Managing Director of that hospital joined our team as an advising partner and we designed a solution to the problem of inefficient internal hospital communications (starting with ER and ancillary departments) in partnership with our advisors and numerous clinicians. Shortly later DCH and our advising partner Puneet committed to pilot our solution.

 Our inspiration is from another application like SmartCity which is that application has been work in any city on Indonesia. Ayo Banyuwangi will give information about Banyuwangi tourism, art events, crafts, culinary, arts and culture. Ayo Banyuwangi will be provide geographic information in a map to make it easier for tourists to reach the destination. We focus on  how tourist can be more interested and know about Banyuwangi culture, art event or their culinary. Then they can get to destinations easly using our maps that we have provided which is by applying Google Maps API. 
 IT folks are usually occupied and overloaded with development & QA work. Thus they tend to miss on updating their daily progress & status of task they worked on. Such miss in updates create big risk for software project and may lead to problems like lack of traceability & delivery slippage. This can eventually result in loss of business.

 Whether it's an entirely different country or a town right next door, travelling according to well-known "popular"destinations isn't often indicitive of the culture and the rich history behind that location. I've been to Niagara Falls no less than 7 times so far; however, the only experience that I remember from those 7 is the time when I went with a mutual friend who is a native of Niagara Falls. He offered me different vantage points that truly made this 7th trip to Niagara Falls the most memorable. Why not make your first trip just as memorable?

 PyEmbeo(Graphs embeddings for Neo4j in Python)Graphs databases are a powerful way to represent real world data in a simple and intuitive manner They can effectively capture inherent relationships within the data and provide meaningful insights that cannot be obtained using traditional relational databases. WHAT ARE GRAPH EMBEDDINGS?Machine Learning on graph data has been the talk of the town for quite a while now. With the advantage of using graphs being quite evident; applying machine learning algorithms on graphs can be used for tasks such as graph analysis, link prediction, clustering etc.Graph Embeddings are a way to encode the graph data as vectors that can effectively capture the structural information, such as the graph topology and the node to node relationships in the graph database. These embeddings can then be ingested by ML algorithms for performing various tasksHOW CAN GRAPH EMBEDDINGS BE USED?Graph embeddings can be used to perform various tasks including machine learning tasks.For example, embeddings of two nodes can be used to determine if a relationship can exist between them. Or, given a particular node and a relation, embeddings can be used to find similar nodes and rank them using similarity search algortihmsCommon applications include  knowledge graph completion and drug discovery where new relations can be dicovered between two nodes. Link prediction and  Recommendation systems in cases such as social networks analysis where potential new friendships can be found.PyEmbeoPyEmbeo is a project in python that creates graph embeddings for a Neo4j graph database.Just pass the link to a neo4j graph database from  a commnad line interface, wait for sometime till the embeddings train and you're good to go.The obtained embeddings can be then used to perform other tasks such as similarity search, scoring or ranking. (Note: currently the similarity search task has been implemented, other tasks are still in development)What's next?The next immediate action would be to package the project as a conda/pip package.Adding more tasks like relationship ranking/scoring is definitely a top priority.And much more...Built Withneo4jpythonTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    Global GraphHack    Created by  Just a little attempt to bring the power of graphs and machine learning togetherVedashree PatilNikhil AkkiArun Kutty 
 Recently more people are using Video chat apps such as Snapchat and Snow. However most functions such as filter and games were used more personally and lacked the concept of communicating. The fun of Video chat is that you can show your emotion at the moment and music is a powerful content to build a win-win connection between artists' creativity and general users' everyday life as if 'Instagram Music Sticker' has done since May 2018. (https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/instagram-stories-music/)Facebook already has dominant active users in social media market. Especially, WhatsApp and Messenger are the first and second globally popular mobile messenger apps, so a multi-play experience can intrigue more engagement from users and communities. Our team thought if people could play with their faces and make something in harmony as a band, it would be much more fun. 
 Every day in Mexico City a lot of traffic and contamination is generated when kids are leaving school; this is caused because in almost all the schools, they call the kids when their parents are a few steps from the school door, or right in front of it. This problems can be solved if the schools could prepare the kids and keep them near the exit door before their parents arrival. If every school starts using Pick@School, we would take care of our planet, reducing: contamination, traffic, delivery times, noise; having a better coexistance, and the possibility to have more time with our kids.

 People are either too busy or bored in Singapore. To tackle the problem of people not having things to do but constantly pulling down the screen on facebook, we decided to make a site for people to post interesting things in Singapore. Sort of like a pseudo stomp with less bullshit and more hipster and random stuff for entertainment.Also, google searching for what to do when you're bored in Singapore would return a bunch of cliches. We aim to be the hipster branch of the press, believing that no computer generated algorithm will be able to look into what will be the hip thing tomorrow.

 A fellow founder from the Belgian startup community asked me for help with his Context.IO Apps challenge submission. He is not a developer but he is an amazing hustler, so I decided to help him. From my own experience I know how hard it can be for a non-technical startup founder. That is why with my colleagues we built a Graphical UI for Context.IO in Drupal to help anyone who can click their way through a configuration screen make their own email applications.Potential impactThere are just under a 100 thousand users actively contributing to the Drupal project. With the Context.IO module it is now really easy for them to create email applications. We expect that the open sourced Context.IO module will have some or all of the following impact:Some of the sites that currently use Mailhandler will switch over to Context.IOSome of Drupal's 502 distributions (e.g. ticketing packages) will start including the Context.IO module into their downloadable packageSite builders will start using the Context.IO module in their new projectsAdministrators will develop email applications for their organisationsWhen you choose our submission for the competition you give us the funding to further promote it in the community.

 Throughout history, we've invented better and better ways of interfacing with machines. The mouse, the VirtualBoy, the nub mouse thing on ThinkPads. But we weren't satisfied with the current state of input devices. As computers become more and more personal and more and more a part of our daily lives, we need better, more efficient ways of interacting with them. One of the biggest inefficiencies in modern desktop computing is moving your hands from the keyboard to the track pad. So we got rid of that. Yup. Really.Introducing asdfghjkl , a revolution in computer-human interface design patterns, by team "Keyboard as Trackpad".http://asdfghjkl.co 
 The idea for sizeOf came about when Davis saw how much data his DSLR camera gave for his pictures. Using some simple trig we are able to deduce the size of real life object using nothing but the data from the camera and computation. How it worksWith only a picture and some information about the camera and lens, we are able to calculate the approximate real height and width of an object in focus.  Simply point the camera at an object, tap to focus, and drag a crop box around the object of interest to get the real size of that object, in meters.The math is derived from lens formulae and some simple trigonometry.  Challenges I ran intoEvery camera is different, and almost every variable is non-linear.  This makes creating solutions difficult.  Accomplishments that I'm proud ofWe were able to get sub-centimeter accuracy in the .1m to .5m focal range, and +/- 10cm accuracy at medium to long ranges.  On an SLR, +/- 1cm accuracy was possible on .5m to 3m range.What I learnedAdam tried Android development for the first time, and was very successful. What's next for sizeOfWe're looking to create calibration curves for more cameras and eventually package the software into an easy to use open-source API for others to implement.

 In our team, we have been using Excel for years. At some point we decided to share our know-hows. That is how XLTools add-in was born. Initially we created it as a VSTO-based add-in written in C#. The product became very successful. So far, XLTools has been downloaded 167,000 times and installed on 45,000 unique PCs across 146 countries.However, VSTO work only on Windows. That is why we were so exited when new the cross-platform JavaScript API appeared. We implemented a subset of the most successful tools from our VSTO add-in and made them cross-platform and mobile friendly. But JavaScript API 1.0 had some limitations:VSTO add-in had a custom tab in the ribbon UI, while the new apps were "hidden" on the "Insert" tabThere was no way to build  single suite of tools, same as we had built with VSTOWith the JavaScript API 1.1 it all changed. We were very excited with the possibility to create custom tabs and add-in commands for the Excel ribbon UI as well as the ability for central deployment. We decided to build XLTools Suite - an app that bundled all our tools into a single tab. 
 We wanted to make it easy for JIRA customers to automate their teams' processes.  Current solutions all require deep knowledge of JIRA's APIs or some developer skills to write scripts.  Not all JIRA admins have those skills nor do they want to spend time learning them. Our inspiration was to provide a simple, yet incredibly powerful user experience that hides all the complexity from the user.  We also want to make it easier to integrate JIRA with third party systems.

 Almost everyone in this planet has a smartphone in the pocket, and almost everyone has played a mobile game at least once, in consequence games became part of our everyday life. Education specialist have recognized the addictiveness of games and took advantage of the technology to inspire the creation educational games, also known as serious games, which engage and motivate students in the learning process while having fun doing it. As a results student concentration was achieved and the learning outcome was impressively improved. These results has inspired us to take this technology to the next level and make the interaction between students and machine more engaging and human-like. What it DoesCreate a solution that will allow interacting with a game using the natural language instead of keyboard buttons, joysticks or touchscreen. How we Built itThe first phase, we created a very simple game that interact with virtual characters using ChatBot text input. We integrated Ciscospark bot, NLP and used Unity 3D as a game engine. Accomplishment we’re proud ofWe created game that interact with games using the natural language.What’s next for V-ControlThe second phase, we will replace the simple game with an educational game that will also track the user’s learning outcome.The third phase will be using speech recognition instead of text. where the Gamer/student could interact with game objects using voice only.Built Withbody-parserbotkitciscosparkclientexpress.jsnode.jsunitywit.aiTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    Cisco Spark the Industry Challenge    Created by  Working on the NLP side.Youssef BoulidComputer scientistwalid mestadiResearch interests include learning, serious games, software architecture and AIAbderrahman WagagMoustafa Ouagague

 Étant un groupe d'étudiants dans une ville aussi active que Montréal, il nous est souvent arrivé de nous retrouver dehors, tard le soir, sans plus aucun métros en circulation. Le moyen le plus économique, pour de modestes étudiants est donc le réseau de nuit de la STM (Société des Transports de Montréal). Malheureusement les arrêts desservis par ce réseau spécial sont très irréguliers, et il nous est souvent arriver d'attendre plus de 30min, dans le froid, en pleine nuit, à un arrêt. C'est de cette souffrance qu'est née notre idée de Nimbus.Nimbus, qu'est-ce que c'est?Nimbus c'est une flotte de véhicules au concept novateur, en effet, au lieu d'avoir des trajets fixes comme il se fait actuellement, la flotte de véhicule Nimbus se dispatchent de manière synchrone en prenant des trajets non fixés préalablement mais qui dépendent de la demande des utilisateurs. Les trajets sont recalculés en temps réel en permanence pour offrir une trajectoire en tout temps optimale, limitant ainsi le temps d'attentes des usagers! Comment l'a-t-on fait?Pour mettre sur pieds Nimbus, nous avons mis au point une web app qui sert de vitrine pour le system de monitoring de la flotte. Nous avons programmé tout le back-end en Python à l'aide du framework Django, pour la partie front-end, Javascript/ReactJS ont su faire le boulot pour le niveau de dynamisme dont nous avions besoin.Nos defisOn a dû attaquer le fameux « travelling salesman problem » pour trouver les trajectoires les plus efficaces incluant les points d’embarquement et de descente. Cet algorithme, grand classique de sa catégorie nous a causé bien du fil à retordre, tant bien même que nous nous sommes, après plusieurs heures à essayer d'implémenter notre prople solution, résolu à passer par un API qui nous a permi de faire abstraction des notions de maths poussés conduisant à sa résolution. Ainsi, nous avons pu nous consacrer à d'autres problématiques que l'API ne prenait pas en compte et dont nous avons dû construire le business logic pour mener à bien notre projet. Nos accomplissementsOn est extrêmement fiers du résultat final! On a finalisé une web app capable de calculer la meilleure trajectoire en fonction des besoins de tous les passagers en recevant les coordonnées GPS du passager ainsi que de sa destination comme input.L'experience qu'on en a tiréEn n'ayant que 24h à travailler sur un problème aussi ambitieux on a surtout appris à gérer notre temps en fonction de nos priorités (et oui, on a appliqué l'algorithme d'optimisation sur nous même finalement). En effet, notre idée de base était beaucoup plus vaste et comportait beaucoup plus de fonctionnalités, mais faute de temps, nous avons dû éliminer celles qui ne nous aurait pas forcément bénéficier sur le court-terme. Et pour aprèsNimbus a le potentiel d’améliorer la qualité de service offert par la société de transport de Montréal d’une manière significative. Après avoir introduit leur passagers à ce système pour les autobus de nuits, la STM pourrait proposer ce type de service pour tous les autobus en dehors des heures de pointe, ce qui leur permettra de fournir un service de meilleure qualité tout en étant efficaces et économiques.Built Withamazon-web-servicesapihtml5javascriptnginxpythonreacttspTry it outwww.github.com      Submitted to    Hackatown    Created by  Kevyn Bele-BindaMohamed CoulibaliIon Banaru

 With the onset of machine learning capabilities, it's become easier and easier to train machines to detect minute and subtle changes.  Recognizing a human face, for one, is something all of us are good at in varying degrees.  However, recognizing and memorizing hundreds and thousands of faces in order to see if a missing person is found or if rescued people found under a collapsed building are related to anyone searching for them is very hard if not, near impossible.  We thought that it would make sense to allow technology to step up and help out with reconnecting people to their loved ones.

 Growing up as child with little or no experience with computer and also finding yourself in a polytechnic where tech guys rule and those who have no knowledge or bad at programming are not really valued. My name is Olabode Oyinkansola Abdul Qudus  i started programming with paper and pen using red pen to mark my error, black for keywords and blue for the other part. I finally got a system during my second semester as a first year student of the institution and took it has a task to help other student who have no system by helping them with practicals and assignment although this later turn to business and a team named UnifyConcept emerge to help making innovation simple with little or no cost. My team and i really think we can make a difference but no opportunity showed up nor sponsorship until now when we have an avenue to do what we do best. I came across a link telling me about NaijaHacks on a dev whatsapp group so i informed my guys about it of which we plan on working on a project called Steganography  but we asked ourselves questions how does Steganography affect or solve a problem in Nigeria? of which the answers we have are not genuine enough. A team mate who happens to be a much more concentrated Yoruba boy more than i do by the name Akinwunmi Oladele said what if we teach people our language and let them see the beauty of our culture through our language.The problem of language teaching and language use is a global one. Several studies have been carried out and several attempts have been made by individuals, government agents and other stakes holders in the education sector with several policies formulated, all in an effort to address the problems militating against effective language teaching and language use in our schools, with the aim of bringing an improvement to the much important phenomenon of which none as being done until now.  
  
  
 "Employment is often considered an important indicator for immigrant integration. Entering the labour market has great significance for people moving to Finland, but also for the Finnish society and, at local level, for the municipality.Acquiring and retaining work enables immigrants to earn an income and stabilise their economic situation. It also helps them take their place in the community and the new home country: to learn the language and cultural practices, to understand how the municipality and Finnish society work, as well as how to build social relationships and networks." (http://www.kvartti.fi/en/articles/immigrants-and-employment-helsinki)."less unemployed people there are, more wellbeing there is in the world."

The project is still in beta, but fully working solution that you can install in your own web site and Microsoft Teams.  
 Investing is an art, not a science. In global money flow markets dictated by growth and value investing, individuals often look at a myriad of non-financial news updates beyond financial analytics of a company on issues including management, innovation, and expansion to guide decision-making. But, not all investors have the same principles or styles even when looking at similar firms: thus, while generic updates can be found by the Google Engine or NASDAQ, there exists a deep information asymmetry since it is difficult to find tailored relevant news that truly affect a specific individual's cognitive processes. Thus, we were inspired to build a full-stack application that displays news reports to an investor and which, based on user feedback (relevant/not relevant), continuously 'learns' investor's style to better present relevant articles about a firm to aid investing activities.

 One of the holy grails of creating connected, supportive communities is figuring out how to drive members to contribute their unique skills to help each other in real life.

 Ever since we were young children, we wanted to explore the universe as we both had a common passion for space and astronomy. Originally, we thought of creating a voice driven skill that took advantage of Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service that told stories to children. However, we realized there were two essential flaws with this idea. The first was that stories required little to no user interaction and we really wanted to harness the potential of using voice with Amazon Alexa. The second main flaw was that as humans, we are better visual learners than we are auditory (nearly 7 times more)!  To solve this, we created a dynamic augmented reality experience that immerses children in a new environment and helps them learn about the solar system and satisfy their curiosity. 
 The planet, as a global community, needs people working together as allies to create forward progress. It is in this shared togetherness that I want to create a tool(s) of empowerment that helps users make informed choices.Simply being gay doesn’t automatically make someone aware of their rights in countries they travel. Allies often learn something later and say, “I had no idea, if I had known I would have made a different decision.” It is exactly these kinds of reactions that made me realize I want to find ways to activate awareness and allyship from within our global community.  It is both the LGBTIQ person and the well-intentioned ally who need easily distributable tools of empowerment to help them make choices that are right for them. In targeting both groups simultaneously I want to support our global community in becoming a Planet of Allies.As a social media activist and specialist, I have instinctively started to crowd source this idea and have created a Global Advisory team, made up of amazing thought leaders and activists to help me best work through the labyrinth of opportunities and challenges as we embark on this journey.

 Free Feet treats gait freezing, a symptom which affects approximately 72% of people with Parkinson's. Every hour, someone in the UK is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, showing just how large the scale of the problem I'm trying to treat is. The inspiration behind Free Feet came from when I was discussing treatments for Parkinson's patients, at  the kitchen table, with my brother, who is a movement disorders (Parkinson's) nurse. He said that there weren't many treatments available for gait freezing, so I decided to see what I could do to help. This is where the idea of Free Feet was born. I also have an emotional connection to Parkinson's as I have a neighbour who sufferers from the illness, so I knew the impact that both gait freezing, and Parkinson's can have on quality of life. This really inspired me to pursue and develop my idea, as there is no known cure for Parkinson's, finding new ways of treating it is really important.How it worksFree Feet treats gait freezing in Parkinson's Disease. It is a laser device attached to the side of a shoe which is designed to help reduce gait freezing for Parkinson's sufferers. Gait freezing is a very common symptom which affects approximately 72% of people with Parkinson's, it is a shuffling movement in the legs and feet. The laser places a red dot on the ground in front of the user. This then changes the users walking from being automatic to non-automatic. This is really important, as in Parkinson's, there is a deficiency in the neurotransmitter (chemical) dopamine. Dopamine is responsible for movement and muscular action, so when there's a deficiency in dopamine, reduced mobility also occurs. However, the midbrain is more severely affected than the frontal lobes. Free Feet works by enabling the user to change their walking from being automatic to non-automatic, when they focus on the dot. This is really important, as it means that the user employs the frontal lobes instead of the midbrain, meaning there is more dopamine available to them, and therefore more ability for movement to occur, thus decreasing the severity of the gait freezing episode. Small scale clinical trials, which we have carried out in collaboration with the Galway Parkinson's Association have shown very positive results, with an approximate decrease in freezing severity of 40%.Challenges I ran intoI have faced many challenges in the development of Free Feet, as being a young woman in STEM, I have always been in the minority of my peer group. I have faced the challenge of overcoming the barrier of youth, as in professional situations, such as networking events, it is hard to ensure that you and your ideas are taken seriously and that your work is appreciated for its full value. An example of this I like to share is a networking event which I attended recently, and because of my age, I was asked if I was looking for one of my parents. I thought that this was certainly a situation in which I was not being taken seriously, and overcame that challenge by explaining my presence and work. I have also faced the challenge of balancing my work and school life, whilst working on the development of Free Feet, I have completed the A-Level equivalent exams (Irish Leaving Certificate) and earned my first choice course in University (Biotechnology). I thought that this was quite a challenge, as I had to balance my time and resources very carefully, but it worked out for the better in the end!I also faced the challenge of learning the technical skills necessary to build the prototype of the device. Free Feet is a device which I built myself, at my kitchen table. In order to do this I needed to learn electronics, soldering and stitching skills, and they were quite the challenge to master!Accomplishments that I'm proud ofI'm very proud that I have successfully trialled a medical device which I created at my kitchen table, and have found that it could help reduce the severity of gait freezing by such a vast percentage.I'm really proud, that against the odds, and people telling me that it would not be possible, I've kept making progress with the commercialisation of my device. I'm very proud that I have recieved the backing of my national medical device association, the IMDA, and that they believed in me and my abilities enough to invest in my personal development.I'm also really proud that developing my device now means, that I have, at my fingertips, the potential to help millions of people around the world suffering from Parkinson's disease. I think that it is really fantastic to be able to reach out and help others through technology, and I'm immensely proud of what I have achieved thus far. I'm really proud of getting into the outbox incubator, its something that I never thought would have been possible for me to achieve, and I'm just delighted.I was really proud to get the opportunity to present Free Feet to our national minister for health, and to learn that he was very impressed with it was fantastic, he said that he hopes to see it in use in the very near future.What I learnedI learnt a lot about how a company works and how to properly forecast financial expenditure. I also learnt more about brand image and how to appropriatly convert that to the consumer. This has led to me being much more conscious regards the logo aand web presence of the business.What's next for Free FeetFree Feet now needs funds in order to be able to reach its full potential.

Those noble artists in the history not only have left us mind blowing masterpieces but also presented us the freedom of expressing themselves. When we are creating MONA, we hope to build a bridge between those great artists and every one in our normal life. Reliving those artists' style in people's every day photos, we want to tell our users that every moment in your life is a pretty perishable and you are the artist of your life.

 After a conversation about how to create a better way to conduct discussions online centered around transportation issues, something beyond a forum where information is shared in real time and associated with geographical data, something that could produce reports about what issues concern people, and be central and scalable enough to be applied in any transportation network, we came up with Mobility Map!How it worksPeople sign in using Facebook or Twitter, make their way to the form, and start posting "Hints" about transportation around the map. Categories help them narrow down the purpose of the hint and allow others to easily search the map for relevant discussions.Challenges I ran intoUsing Shareabouts, Wilson and I have discovered the woes of hacking into a platform that uses many levels of abstraction: Django, Handlebars, Backbone, Postgres, Postgis, etc etc...Also, VTA data is not very easily accessible. A lot of it is directly stored as variables in javascript files and not in any template forms.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofOur constant momentum, and the level of collaboration this project has led us to, not to mention our knack for hacking into complicated software, figuring it out, fixing bugs, and making it work for us.What I learnedSome VTA data is hard to pull, but also that people are interested in being able to connect with others online about transportation.What's next for Mobility MapScaling! Also, numerous niche features to help people participate, such as upvoting comments in realtime, a user interface for signing up for data reports, and icons that don't fold behind one another on the map.Built Withbackbone.jschefdjangogunicornhandlebars.jsnginxnode.jspostgispostgresqlshareaboutssupervisorubuntuvagrantTry it outmobilitymap.org      Submitted to    Hack My Ride 2.0Winner                Third Prize                  Created by  Zach Pallin,Wilson Wang,Betsy MegasZachary PallinOperations DeveloperWilson Wang

 For many people, the thought alone of an MRI is enough to cause a full-blown panic attack.Approximately 9 percent of people have a clinical diagnosis of claustrophobia or a fear of enclosed places, according to a study in the journal Psychological Medicine. Yet experts agree that simply feeling claustrophobic during an MRI is common for most people, even those without a phobia. So we decided to produce a virtual reality application,which will reduce such fears. 
  
 This is a service that I always wished existed. It is a simple way to make life a little easier. Why not streamline something that everyone hates doing?How I built it The add-in itself just uses plain old JavaScript with the Office.js library. The UI components are a mix of custom css and a framework named skeleton.css. The add-in is hosted on a nodejs server. The supporting back end is also hosted with node.Challenges I ran into The biggest issue I ran into was browser support. I initially had an issue with the code becoming overwhelming with callbacks. I decided to use promises to clean up the code. Which worked well but while testing I found that IE didn't support the promises API. To solve this I added in a polyfill and it has been working very well since.Accomplishments that I'm proud of I'm very happy with the user experience of the add-in. It is very easy to get started and provide value right away. I believe the users will find this add-in easy and helpful.What I learned I learned that the Office API is pretty awesome. It was a pleasure to work with. Especially the well known objects. That made getting phone numbers & emails really easy for read type of appointments. I was pleasantly surprised by that.What's next for LineOne The add-in store! Here we come. I'd also like to enhance the experience a little further by making use of EWS.

 Last week I was reading a newspaper when I came across a story about how two women were brutally beaten (one of whom eventually died) after a home invader found them hiding under a bed. When asked why she didn't call the police immediately, the women said she was scared if the phone made noise or if she talked too loud the intruder would hear and find them. This story was very unsettling, and after some research I found it wasn't a rare occurrence either. There are over 3 million home invasions and burglaries in the US every year, and nearly half of those invaders are lethally armed. These victims who were killed by invaders were people: they had lives, families, friends, and they should have had futures too. My goal was to find a way to stop these lethal situations from happening, and to save the lives of future victims.How it worksRoboCop allows a person to silently and quickly call emergency services without the need to speak or spend time dialing and then explaining the situation. Within seconds of opening the app the police are called and given your GPS coordinates. Any additional information you give the service, such as exact location in the building or your current situation, will be translated from text to speech using IBM's Watson and sent to the police station using IBM Bluemix and Twilio.Challenges I ran intoBoth the accuracy of location and sending out the call quickly were important to get emergency services to the user as rapidly as possible. Seconds can make the difference between life and death in some cases, and we had to ensure we could balance these two components to minimize response time. By allowing the app to send new information as it became available, rather than all at one time, we were able to allow near instant calling when the app is opened.Accomplishments that I'm proud of & What I learnedBecause almost every emergency service call center in the US cannot receive text or non-audio information and home invasions are a real danger, we are proud that our app has the potential to save lives that might have otherwise been lost. I have never worked on an app before, and have mostly just worked in data science. Many of the components and steps in this project were completely new to me, but I didn't give up!What's next for RoboCopUsing a custom phone launcher, we hope to be able to add a "stealth call" feature that calls the police based off of a button click combination (ex.- power button clicked and then volume-up button clicked four times) so the service can be used without the use of a screen and while still in a person's pocket. This might be useful to those in situations where they need to call the police but cannot due to a person watching them such as during a mugging or a physically abusive relationship.Built Withandroidbluemixbootstrapcsshtml5ibm-watsoniosjavascriptphonegapsmartphonetwiliowindows-phone      Submitted to    HackUMassWinner                Communication Innovation Award              Winner                Finalist              Winner                Champion              Winner                IBM Bluemix Cloud Development Innovation Award                  Created by  Frontend, UX, presentation, etc..David NearyRhode Island and Massachusetts.

 As security geeks, we wanted a local Ethereum wallet with a small attack surface, a front-end easy enough for non-technical users to use securely, and hardware wallet support. None of the existing options met our needs; for instance:Mist still runs Chromium 54, which was released in April of last year, and thus is vulnerable to old Chromium vulnerabilities. In fact this caused them to issue a severe security alert recently: https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/12/15/security-alert-chromium-vulnerability-affecting-mist-browser-beta/. Furthermore Mist runs without Chromium's renderer sandbox, so many high-severity vulnerabilities in Chromium are actually critical vulnerabilities in Mist that can lead to full system compromise. Mist's advice is "don't browse to untrusted websites", but it's unclear that non-technical users can practically follow this advice, since Mist makes it easy to browse to untrusted websites in their Electron interface.MetaMask lacks hardware wallet support. https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/717wallet.ethereum.org is a remote website with poor XSS protection since it doesn't define a Content Security Policy. Furthermore, websites lack the same level of code integrity as apps since they are not signed/versioned and can be modified without detection by the server operator at any time. Thus an attacker only needs to compromise the wallet.ethereum.org web server in order to compromise its users' wallets. In addition, websites are prone to phishing attacks.Same with MyEtherWallet, although they now have a Chrome extension. However, it's unclear whether to what extent the extension is stable or recommended. (See https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/issues/1406#issuecomment-352719852 for instance.)Parity runs a local web interface. This is a great approach but their app is not code-signed and previously on MacOS was downloaded over plain HTTP (https://github.com/paritytech/homebrew-paritytech/issues/65). It is also not the most friendly tool for non-technical users, since it requires downloading a command line tool (https://paritytech.github.io/wiki/Setup) and running terminal commands. This state of affairs was concerning to us. You shouldn't have to be a security expert in order to have a secure Ethereum wallet!

 The Hackathon to use Azure IoT and Serverless functionality was the catalyst for me to build this project. Last year I built a WebApp version that allowed a Service Desk or IT Admin to search for a person and get a report on that uses metadata from Microsoft Identity Manager. The natural extension is therefore to use spoken word to query and have the result spoken back. It also provided me with the impetus to learn how to use and integrate a number of new Azure Services I previously hadn’t used.  
 The inspiration behind our novelty hack was to eliminate the chip for good. Our prototype device receives transmitted credit card data through flashes of light that represent binary, and stores the data string via photoresistor. From there, it interprets high and low voltages as 1's and 0's and seamlessly saves all of your credit cards in a single device. You can now ditch your wallet, and actually broadcast the encrypted data via an electromagnetic field that we generate through several motor drivers, so you can make purchases at any Point-of-Sales terminal. On top of that, we create an air-tight means of data transmission! The inspiration behind this invention was technology such as Swipe or Square. They encrypt magstripe data into an audio file, but there have been known ways to break this. We thought outside-the-box, and created a way to transmit this sensitive data via LIGHT instead, which is virtually unhackable because there are no scenarios where there can be interceptable packets.   How we built itClaire Li wrote the Android application that communicates the binary light signals, and created the hardware portion of the hack that recieves the magstripe data into the device. We send the photoresistor signals into an analog input pin in an Arduino Uno, then route it to a Raspberry Pi that interprets the information. Ben Roytenberg created the hardware portion of the hack that broadcasts the data to POS-terminals for real purchases, and interpreted the stored magstripe data. He generates the electromagnetic field with this information via stepper motor driver. Challenges we ran intoThis was a very complex hack, and we ran into obstacles across every form of technology we worked with. From the first night, we realized we had to SSH headless into a Raspberry Pi and got stalled with running even the most basic scripts or checking that the photoresistor circuit was even working (it definitely wasn't, and had to be redone three or four times with help). Claire ran into issues with multi-threading and controlling the flash on an Android device to communicate the light data, and getting the photoresistor circuit to work. She had to also find a way to package the information and pass it to Ben's portion of the hardware. Ben ran into issues such as researching Track 1, and Track 2 data for credit card magstripes, and coming up with the technology to generate the electromagnetic field, and doing a lot of prototyping and testing to ensure the data is being emitted correctly.Accomplishments that we're proud ofThrowing together the entire hack as a two-man team, and working across software and hardware, and creating a device that challenged us not only as software engineers, but also as taught us a lot about embedded systems and financial security technology.What we learnedWhere there is a will, there is a way!What's next for LightSwipeAdding multi-colored LED's that show live progress of transmission, and setting up a web UI that also shows transactions.Built Withandroidarduinocphotoresistorspythonraspberry-pi      Submitted to    MHacks 8    Created by  Ben RoytenbergClaire Li21 yr old software engineer, back end developer, Android dev, embedded systems, SQL!

 Tangentia Automation consultants were speaking to a large customer in India who were implementing UIPath for their Accounts Payable process and they were receiving invoices from their vendors in multiple formats and their accuracy was only around 60%. Tangentia has a separate business unit called Tangentia EDI that manages EDI for 1000+ companies worldwide. At a water cooler, a Tangentia Automation consultant ran into a Tangentia EDI consultant and they spoke about how they would each approach an Accounts Payable process automation and then we had our eureka moment- why not create an EDI connector from UIPath and that is how we got started on this. The business case: Many companies and many of their vendors already have some EDI infrastructure in place to exchange structured business documents and if we bring those documents within RPA enabled process, we could definitely increase our accuracy within the process as a whole, as well as make the processes easily scalable.

 We are a group of students from the Cooper Union interested in the environment!Current debates on global warming and the environment make us aware of the pollution around us. And we are wondering: what are we breathing everyday? Where do all these pollutants come from. 
 For two years, the people of Flint, Michigan were unwittingly drinking water contaminated by lead in poisonous concentrations. The residents had no idea that they were drinking water that could and would eventually lead to several serious medical conditions. They had no way of verifying that the dirty and off-smelling water was safe like the government told them.Most current lead testing devices are kits that are single use and need to be sent to a lab, using time and money. Our goal is not only to create an affordable and accurate lead detection system, but to keep a real time graph of lead levels that can be easily accessed from the Internet. Not only is our system for long-term use, there is no hassle of sending it to labs because the readings come at a constant interval. 
 The rate at which information is searched out daily by students on the net is alarming and could also be time consuming especially when desired solutions are not found within an expected time and cost of purchase of text books and  handouts is on the high side.

 Please all US based mobile number to be used in either signup or in creating Users Emergency Contact list must begin with +1 followed by the 10 last digitSaviour is an awesome personalized and safety app that empowers users to summon help in the event of Sexual assults, Kidnapping,domestic violence, road accidents, medical/health threatening situations etc. All Communications within this app are tranversed via Phone Call and SMS.Saviour allows Users to tell Police, Safety Agencies, friends and family when they are in danger or in a critical life threatening situations.Senders Location is automatically detected and capture by using 3rd party free Geolocation API(ipinfodb.com)which was further geo-coded with Google Map Places API to obtain users immediate geolocation data and then broadcastthe Information and links contains full details to the Users Contacts...Some of the Information detected and broadcasted includes:1.) Users Longitude and Latitude Cordinates2.) Users location City, State, Region, Country3.) Five Users Nearest geolocation Addresses.4.) Five Users Nearest Geolocation Police Stations 5.) Five Users Nearest Geolocation Emergency Health/HospitalsA link containing all this Users Geolocation Data are sent to the corresponding recipients so that they will see how close they are to the Senders emergency locations.The alerts can be sent to up to 10 contacts at a single push and can be recieved by police, Security agencies,Friends, family members  who their detailed Phone numbers has been inputed by the User.All registered Users Contacts are periodically notified by Phone Calls and SMS messages on their smartphones at regular intervals depending on the EMERGENCY button option that was Pressed.Saviour sorts the Users Contacts info in an order for which data was inputted  seperating Emergency Phone-Call components from SMS Based notification alert System thus in this way,users do not have to rush around finding her friends,police etc in her phonebook, typing the message and then sending it out which is not possible when the User is in panic or in danger.Consequently, to help visually impaired people(People with sight problem),  the app allows Users to input her Emergency Contacts along with theirs Photos, the app automatically load all the photos and Names of of the Users registered contacts on the screen, and then you can tap on any of the photos to initialize call and be connected with the person in real-time. Finally, Saviour app has three major Emergency Buttons1.)Red Alert Button:   tells contacts the sender is in critical dangerthat needs immediate response.Eg. Being Hurt, Attacked,Sexual Assault,Fatal Road accident etc.2.)Orange Alert Button:   tells contacts the sender will need help as soon though not urgent.3.)green Alert Button:   tells contacts the sender is in a low risk eg. Being Lost,Car break-down etc...Platform of AvailabilityAndroid, Web & Mobile Web.Apps Screenshots Scenario and UseabilityThe Screenshot below show the Apps Landing PageThe Screenshot Below show Users  Uploading His Profile Pictures,br>The Screenshot Below show Users login into the appThe Screenshot Below show Users Signup formThe Screenshot Below show Users show Users Updating Her Emergency Contacts..The Screenshot Below show Users Interacting with Her Emergency Contacts.The Screenshot Below show Users Initializing Phone Calls to Her Emergency Contacts.The Screenshot Below show users Geo Tracked Information's.How to test the Demo....I Just created one account but you can create as many as possibleUsername: testpassword: testFirst Signup within the app either from the Mobile web or from the android version. The app will request that you upload your profile Picture, and login.  on the Landing Page, you are presented with 4 ComponentsAdding Components: Allows the User to Update her Emergency Contacts Details including Names, Photos and Phone Number. This Emergency Contacts will be used by the User in Emergency Situations rather than going through her Phonebook which will create panic in a life threatening situations. SMS Components: Allows the User to send real-time Emergency messages to all her contacts at a single push to maximum of 10 registered contacts.The Red Button alerts  means that the situation is critical and the user sending it needs an immediate urgency needs Eg A user having Fatal Accident, Kidnapping, Sexual Assaults.The Orange Button alerts  means that the sender  might be in danger...The green Button alerts  means that the sender  is at low risk. Eg. having a car-break down,being lost, looking for something etc..Each time an Emergency button is clicked, the app automatically send an SMS Message broadcast to all the senders contacts regarding the situation along with the randomly generated URL links containing Senders Emergency Locations information's. The broadcast-ed information's includes1.) Users Longitude and Latitude Cordinates2.) Users location City, State, Region, Country3.) Five Users Nearest geolocation Addresses.4.) Five Users Nearest Geolocation Police Stations 5.) Five Users Nearest Geolocation Emergency Health/HospitalsCall: Allows the User to Initialized Phone Calls to her Emergency contacts . It show the photos representing each of the contacts  and this has a long way in helping people with impaired vision.History: Keeps Sender inform of all her geo-captured data as been detected and captured during emergency situation in real-time.

 Are You a Non-Diabetics(Free of Diabetes), Pre-Diabetics(precursor stage before diabetes mellitus) or Diabetics(Sufferer of Diabetes). Its time to know. Start Using this app now...You can study information on this link below to better understand things about Blood/Glucose Levels ranges in the bodyhttp://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes_care/blood-sugar-level-ranges.htmlConsequently,  The Standard blood Glucose Level set by NICE Experts were illustrated in the table below for both Non-Diabetic, Pre-Diabetics and Diabetic Patients.Diabetes is a serious illness that requires persistence medical approach and patient self-management education to prevent and reduce the risk of long-term diabetes complications.High blood sugar can reduce blood flow and damage the nerves in your feet. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can lead to serious infections. Diabetes can lead to pain,Dental gum infections,weakening of immune systems,double risk of heart diseases, Strokes, tingling or loss of sensation in your feet.Understanding your blood glucose level ranges plays a vital roles in the effective management of diabetes. If someone with diabetes has a Glucose meter, test strips and is testing, it's vital to know your blood glucose level. This test may be carried out before or 2 hours after meal.The test can also be carried out before excercise, at bedtime or during fasting.In the United State, blood sugar is normally measured in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dl). A milligram is very little, about 0.00018 of a teaspoon. A deciliter is about 3 1/3 ounces.In  Canada and the United Kingdom, blood sugar level is reported in millimoles/liter (mmol/L). You can convert Canadian or British glucose levels to American numbers by multiplying the obtained values in (mmol/L) by factor of  18.If someone from Britain, Canada reports that their fasting blood glucose was (6mmol/L), you can multiply that by 18 and get their U.S. glucose level of 108 mg/dl.Diabetic Patients and their respective caregivers must also use pen and a log-book to record their glucose level on daily basis and then brings it in the next follow-up medical appointments in order for the Doctor/Physician to decide on what could be the next line of actionin fighting the diabetes chronic diseases.This is what the apps Does:Glucose Level Check (is a free web, mobile-web and Android apps) that help you monitor and record your Sugar/Glucose Level anytime anywhere.This app enable Diabetic Patients to easily share their data securely and privately with Diabetes Treatment teams,Doctors over SMS,Emails etc. in order to help you and your doctor see how your treatment is working and to know possibly what could be the next treatment options. Consequently, the app also check if the User is a Diabetic,Pre-Diabetic or a Diabetic).The app also allow User to enter her glucose level readings, the kind of food he or she eats, Time period for eating to see how the foods affects her glucose level and to actually determine if She is a  Non-Diabetic, Pre-Diabetic or a Diabetic PatientsThe app also allow Users to make Notes of other observations by asking some of the questions below"Do You have cuts and blisters that refuses to be healed?. What about pain,Dental gum infections, Sores, redness or swelling, weakening of immune systems,tingling or loss of sensation in your feet etc ?."This will help to check if the Diabetic Patients infected or not..The present Standard for patients Diabetes Management is to monitor and record the foods and glucose daily reading eg from a Glucose Meter on a paper log and then brings it in the next follow-up medical appointments. However,these Paper Logs may be dirty, stained with fluid/bloods, inconsistent and there is high possibility that the Patients can easily forget it at home and this can delay further treament options.Patients and Diabetes Treatment Teams can track the diabetic readings statistically via Column Chart,Line-Chart distribution analysis.Glucose Check is an app that empowers both Diabetic, Pre-Diabetic and Non-Diabetic to record and monitor the Kind of food they eat, Time the food was eating and their Blood Glucose Level readings and Share the resultant Data including the graphical Statistical visualization components with their Diabetes Management Teams/Doctors in real-time, not just when they have a scheduled medical appointment.Platform of AvailabilityAndroid, Web & Mobile Web.Apps Screenshots Scenario and UseabilityThe Screenshot below show the Apps Landing PageThe Screenshot Below show Users making registrations from within the appThe Screenshot Below show Users  Uploading His Profile Pictures,br>The Screenshot Below show Users login into the appThe Screenshot Below show Users entering her Bloood Sugar Level Data for AnalysisThe Screenshot Below show Users show Users historical Data Over time..The Screenshot Below show Users Statistical Data over time via Column Chart Distribution Analysis.The Screenshot Below show Users sending her Blood Glucose Level Data to her Registered Doctor or Blood Glucose Monitoring Team over SMS within the App.The Screenshot Below show Doctors Accessing his/her office to Attend to Diabetic Patients  Historical Data within his Office AppThe Screenshot Below show Doctors Accessing his/her Diabetic Patients  Data within his officeHow to test the Demo....I Just created one account but you can create as many as possibleUsername: testpassword: testFirst Signup within the app either from the Mobile web or from the android version.

 They have been series of family issues here and there regarding some men being aggressive with their wives, life partners saying that their partner cannot get pregnant despite being medical fit,Some argued that they need either Male or Female Child. However, most times it may be that they are having Sex when the woman is not in her Fertility Period. Millions of Women does not even know when they will be expecting theirPeriods, Ovulations or even Pregrenancy to better plan her sex time period or perhaps for family planning...Understanding your Ovulation & Menstral Cycle plays a vital roles in the effective management of your womenhood System for either becoming Pregnant or avoid it.Ovulation and Menstral Cycle are intercalated in nature. Ovulation? is the release of eggs(ovules) from the female Ovaries. This eggs are available to be fertilized by sperm cell.It a mid-point of menstral Cycle.What the App DoesThis app will enable Users(women)to  monitor and record her Ovulation Cycle/Periods, Knows her next Menstral Period, Her Fertility Period which increases herchances of getting Pregnant or avoiding it which can be tracked on the App History & Calendaring System.it tell the User the actual day She will give birth if She concieve.Consequently, If women has sex before 6 days or more before She Ovulates, the possibility that She will get pregnant is uncertain and absolutely tends to zero.The app also tell you the actual day your egg or ovule is available to be fertilized by Sperm cells. The app will tellyou the actual day that you can have sex so that you can have either a boy or a girl by usingDr. Shettles Mathematical Formula. Shettles discovery indicates, men produce two types of sperms, the X (female) and Y (male). Dr. Shettles' studies suggests the y-sperms are smaller, weaker, but faster than their siblings x-sperms, which are bigger, stronger, but slower.Consequently, According to Dr. Shettles, there are other options in getting either a Male or a Female Child and they includes1.) PH value of Women Varginal Tract.A more acidic varginal tracts favors girls, since it will kill the weaker y-sperms first, leaving a greater quantity of x-sperms available to fertilize the egg. Consequently, a more alkaline environment favors boys.Shettles recommends a douche of water and vinegar (acid) immediately before intercourse to favor a girl; a douche of water and baking soda (alkaline) will help for a boy.Very mportant: Some women are naturally very acidic and may have serious issues producing boys because acidic medium kills  Y-Sperms easily.2.)PH of Women's orgasms.PH is a measure of Alkalinity or Acidity of a medium.  Orgasms mostly occurred when sex is at climax with a partner and the woman is sexually stimulated.When a woman has an orgasm, the body releases some milky fluid substance that makes the environment more alkaline, favoring boys. consequently no orgasms will favour girls!.The book titled "The Case of the Female Orgasm: Bias in the Science of Evolution by Elisabeth Lloyd, Ph.D., a biology professor at Indiana Universitysuggest that to have Orgasm, "Sex Partners needs to relax to build sexual tension."The best preparation for a big orgasm is probably a long, steamy shower, full-body massages by and for your man or 10 minutes of steady oral sex, if you can get it. 3.)Sexual Positioning & PenetrationPositioning during sex and depth of penetration are also affected by PH. Towards entrance to the vagina, women tract is too acidic and thus shallow penetration will favour X-Sperm producing girls. consequently,deep penetration will favour Y-Sperm producing boys because the Sperm are closer to the egg for fertilization.All this Information can be Tracked also from the app History Menu and by Navigating The Menstral Calendering System using Calenders "Next and Previous" buttonThe app will periodically and automatically update the women via SMS components on her next Menstral Period, Ovulation Time, Fertility Time, Non-Pregnancy time ,Male or Female Child conceiving time and Child Birthrate if She conceives all in real-time.Platform of AvailabilityAndroid, Web & Mobile Web.Apps Screenshots Scenario and UseabilityThe Screenshot below show the Apps Landing PageThe Screenshot Below show Users making registrations from within the appThe Screenshot Below show Users  Uploading His Profile Pictures,br>The Screenshot Below show Users entering her Menstral Cycle Data for Analysis/5.png)The Screenshot Below show Users show Users Menstral historical Data Over time..The Screenshot Below show Users Menstral Calendaring SystemHow to test the Demo....I Just created one account but you can create as many as possibleUsername: testpassword: testFirst Signup within the app either from the Mobile web or from the android version.

 High Blood Pressure(HBP) is a serious diseases which affects millions of people world-wide. Its a silent Killer and if leftuncontrolled may results in disability, Kidney diseases, Heart failure, stroke, Sexual dis-functions and final death.Causes of this Blood pressure varies. For instance, it can be caused by Too much salt in the diet, smokking,over-weight,lack of physical exercise, Stress, genetics,certain drugs used in treaments.For instance in Cancer Patients,studies by some Scholars SciELO and LILACS between 1993 and 2013, has showned that High Blood Pressure or Hypertension may be caused by the use of angiogenesis inhibitors(bevacizumab, sorafenib and sunitinib), corticosteroids, erythropoietin in targeted cancer therapy.According to this Scholars, this Hypertension can serve as a risk factor for chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and if not properly controlled, it can negatively affects Cancer treatment plan or even lead to discontinuation of certain therapies.Furthermore according to this scholars, The use of chemotherapy and adjuvant drugs effective in the treatment of cancer increased the survival rate of these patients and, consequently, increased the incidence of hypertension. Morbidity and mortality may increased in patients with cancer and hypertension without proper antihypertensive treatment and therefore, there is need for early diagnosis, effective monitoring, treatment strategies and management tools for hypertension in cancer patients in order to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate. 
 A Breast Cancer Patient is immediately susceptible following any incisions(Surgical Cuts) to remove cancerous Cells.After the surgery, Patients are engulfed with Pains, stress, trauma,anxiety due to the surgery.Drainage System(Eg. Jackson Pratt drainage system) which are long tubes that are placed into the patients breast area or armpit to collect excess fluid that can accumulate in the space where the tumor or cancerous cells was removed from the body.These drainage system are sured to the skin/body like pinatas on a string. Watch the Video from this links and also study the Page Content to  better  understand whatBreast Cancer Drainage is all about.https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/patient-education/caring-your-jackson-pratt-drainage-systemThe drain can last for weeks, However, it depends on your surgery and the amount of drainage coming out from the surgical cuts and patients are expected to carry thedrains pulling at their bodies anywhere they go including going to work, school runs, bathing, cooking,sleeping etc.Consequently, Some people drains alot while others drains little and according to oncological experts the drainage is usually removed when the drainage is 30 mL or less over 24 hours.Patients and caregivers(a person who takes care of the patients) must also record the daily readingsof the drains morning and evening(ie atleast twice a day) in a drainage log and then brings it in the next follow-up medical appointments  in order for the surgeon/Doctor to decide when to remove the drains.This is what the apps Does:Breast Cancer Drainage (is a free web, mobile-web and Android apps) that help you monitor and record your Drain anytime anywhere.This app enable Patients to easily share their data securely and privately with Surgical teams,Doctors  over SMS,Emails etc. in order to have the drainage removed at earliestconvinient. Consequently, The app will alert Patients when the drain readings is 30 mL or less over 24 hours in order to have the drain removed as soon as possible.The app also monitors Patient's Drainage Fluid odour,smell,Significant Bruising and redness around the Incision wound todetermine if the surgical cuts is infected or not..The present Standard for patients Drain Management is to monitor and record the drains daily reading on a paper log andthen brings it in the next follow-up medical appointments. However,these Paper Logs may be dirty, stained with fluid,inconsistent and there is high possibility that the Patientscan easily forget it at home and this can delay the drain unstallations.Patients and Surgical Teams can track the drains readings statistically via Column Chart distribution analysis.Breast Cancer Drainage is an app that empowers patients to have their drains removed at the right time, not just when they have a scheduled medical appointment.Platform of AvailabilityAndroid, Web & Mobile Web.Apps Screenshots Scenario and UseabilityThe Screenshot below show the Apps Landing PageThe Screenshot Below show Users  Uploading His Profile Pictures,br>The Screenshot Below show Users entering her Breast Drainage Fluid Data for AnalysisThe Screenshot Below show Users show Users historical Data Over time..The Screenshot Below show Users Statistical Data over time via Column Chart Distribution Analysis.The Screenshot Below show Users sending her Breast Drainage Data to her Registered Doctor or Surgical Team over SMS within the App.The Screenshot Below show Doctors Accessing his/her office to Attend to Users/Patients BP Historical Data within his Office AppThe Screenshot Below show Doctors Accessing his/her Users/Patients Breast Drainage  Data within his officeHow to test the Demo....I Just created one account but you can create as many as possibleUsername: testpassword: testFirst Signup within the app either from the Mobile web or from the android version.

 Often, it's not the risks that you see coming, but the risks that you dont see coming (the unknown unknowns). How do you plan for a problem that you don't know is coming? This is especially true in the hyperconnected economy that exists in today's world. Players and elements within the economy are becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent. Relationships between these elements are also dynamic and highly complex. 
 We love to do everything in Confluence. And I mean everything. From our development documentations over our contracts to the company retreat planning. The only problem is, especially with long texts, that it's hard to read over a longer period of time, because of the small font size and long line width. Some of us used Safari's reading mode others just hit ⌘+ a few times. But that was annoying in the long run and in reading modes we couldn't comment or use special macros.That's why we built the Reader for Confluence.

 A few hackathons ago some friends and I were watching the towel.blinkelights.nl ASCII Star Wars video and I thought, 'if you can watch a crappy text rendition of Star Wars through telnet, why couldn't you get all of Netflix in your terminal too?' I was so sleep deprived at the time that somehow the thought didn't stick in my head. Several days later I had a flash of "original inspiration" which I was sure I'd never considered before, at least until the aforementioned friends convinced me that I was repeating myself. After a rough start at YHack, I decided I was going to implement this idea. By the time I started it was already close to the deadline. It was a scramble to finish on time, but it came together in the end.  
  
 I have tried different symptoms checker mobile apps, but current there is none that could automatically identify the human features and provide possible symptoms from the human image picture itself.

 Honestly, seeing an API powerful enough to transfer files, regardless of size or type so consistently across platform, I had to make use of it. So I figured that it would be a good bet to make use of it to create an app that allows you to share and transfer document on the go and keep them at one place. Not only that, the document can be from your excel or ppt or even .c or .java files, actually almost all kinds of code files can be viewed in this app, I have ensured that the popular extensions are covered by the app. How it worksThe best part of the app is how it works, it's so easy that even your child or grandparents can use.Just select the files to transfer from the list and click send. A code will be generated which need to be shared with the person you want to send files to. That's it.Same logic applies to the receiving part.Challenges I ran intoWell, yeah there were a few but it was a part of the learning curve.In building this app, i learned loads of stuff core to iOS file management and using file extensions.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofBuilding an app that is very close to what I imagined it to be is really nice.What I learnedLearned about the file management in iOS, file extensions , viewing document, and of course the powerful APIs of the sendAnyhwhere.What's next for FLYDOCIf I see the app being used by people, i'll add more features to make the app's document viewer more customised and and even more refined and especially providing customisation to read the code syntax of various languages like java,c, etc. Built Withiphone6objective-csendanywherexcodeTry it outitunes.apple.com      Submitted to    The Blue Airplane HackWinner                2nd Place                  Created by  I designed and developed this app in order to provide the easiest way to transfer documents in iOS.Umar FarooqueiOS Developer [bit of android as well] 
  
  
  
 As I live in New Jersey but work in New York, I get very little time to teach my kids at home.On one Saturday morning, I tried to teach math tables to my 6 year old. It was difficult. After different trials and errors, I found a way to keep her engaged and entertaining. I told her that we were going to play a game.First, I would draw the first 5 items from two table in big bold letters on a blackboard and challenged her to remember as many as she can. Once she is ready, I would wipe those out, and quiz her the first half of the 2 times table. I am surprised to see her learning quickly. Gamification of teaching tables this way made engaged and entertaining. So, from then on, every Saturday, we would play this game. She not only enjoys this mode of learning but started learning tables quickly. So, I thought of spreading this method to all other parents like me because it is very effective.  I thought the best way to do this is to automate this process so that all other kids can use it in a fun way.After exploring, I found Alexa Presentation Language (APL) with which we can create beautiful, immersive experiences by building an Alexa skill that runs on every device such as Echo, Echo Show, Fire TV, etc.My daughter loves this Alexa skill I have built, and she loves to play it over and over again on our Smart TV (using Amazon Fire stick) and she now knows tables all the way up to 8th table perfectly and she is just in the First Grade :)  
 We've all gone hiking and seen geotagging. We've all seen PokemonGo come and leave, disrupting our lives in ways we didn't see coming. We believe that AR's purpose is to merge reality with the digital world, and we feel that creativity is essential to utilizing AR in the best way possible. That's why we decided to create mARk, an app where you can make AR Art Pieces (or ARt as we like to call it) and share them with the world.

 The open nature of Confluence collaboration is great for project collaboration, reference documentation and team knowledge.  But sometimes Confluence gets used for jobs where you need to produce documentation under a regulated environment or approval of some content.  It could be a press release, some internal policies, or something quick like the submission for your Codegeist entry.Confluence Server users already have the ability to set up reviews and approvals to improve the quality of their content with our Comala Workflows add-on.  However we hadn't been able to offer a solution to Confluence cloud users that would meet our functional and user experience expectations. As the Atlassian connect framework has matured and evolved we can now provide this functionality with the Comala Approvals add-on for Confluence Cloud.

 Large consulting MNC such as Big 4 hires over 90,000 workforce every year to keep up with project client demands. Project managers have to sometimes interview up to 10 candidates for each permanent position they need to fill. Not only does this take up a huge amount of time, it is also costly for companies to have excess full time employees during non-peak periods.While freelance workforce may be a solution for small companies, audit and fraud risk when hiring risky freelancers on top of excessive contracting work makes it impossible for large auditing firm to leverage on such a hiring model in a fail-safe manner.To reduce risk and optimize cost savings for workforce, we came up with DreamForce, an app that allows you to employ an adaptive workforce on demand powered by BlockChain technology to reduce fraud risk.

 The Atlassian Connect framework greatly simplifies and unifies developing add-ons for JIRA Cloud. Unfortunately, plugins for JIRA Server still requires a considerably large amount of inconsistent boilerplate source code on both front-end and back-end sides. This is currently an obstruction in maintaining equal supports for both JIRA Cloud add-ons and JIRA Server plugins, let alone delivering the same user experience on both JIRA environments. We believe that the problem can be solved elegantly if JIRA Server plugins can be generated automatically from their JIRA Cloud counterpart.

 You know that feeling when you land in a new airport and you can’t find anything. Lounges, restaurants, wifi.... Where have they all gone? This bot is a concept for how a personal Assistant can get around this problem, over chat. Also, there is no need for the travelers to download any new app or navigate a complex website in a mobile screen. All that they need to do is start chatting with the Airport Assist bot from FB Messenger, when they enter the airport. 
 We had to take mundane and repetitive online quizzes for our chemistry class and we thought that there had to be a more efficient way to take them. The quizzes were set up on an online site called Pro Profs and they were based off of a larger question bank, we realized that a machine learning robot would be able to learn all of the questions in the question bank and be able to get hundreds on the quizzes.

 My friend and I needed to find an apartment in New York City during the Summer. We found it very difficult to look through multiple listing pages at once so we thought to make a bot to suggest apartments would be helpful. However, we did not stop there. We realized that we could also use Machine Learning so the bot would learn what we like and suggest better apartments. That is why we decided to do RealtyAI 
 The idea for our hack came to us as we decided where we were going to set up for the weekend during the hackathon.

From this, FireNode was born.

 According to world bank statistics, more than 60 Million Nigerians are unbanked (http://venturesafrica.com/more-than-60-million-nigerians-are-not-yet-financially-inclusive/) and this was verified by techpoint Africa that only 40% of Nigerian Adults are banked (https://techpoint.africa/2018/04/23/nigerian-adults-banked/). Which implies that a huge percentage of the Nigerian Populace are unbanked and not financially included. We feel these people need to have access to funds, money, bailouts, sponsorship, etc. Then we thought of reaching them via their National Identity Number (NIN) or their Voter's Identity Number (VIN). NIN and VIN are similar to the Social Security Number and they are unique to every citizen.

 We hated sharing the auxiliary cord and dealing with the bombardment of requests. Why can't we just let everyone have access to the speakers?What It DoesAux allows a host user to login into their Spotify account and create an empty playlist, identified by a pin that can be shared with other listeners. After someone has the playlist pin or 'Aux code', they can access the request system for that playlist. The request system queries Spotify's library and allows the requested songs to be voted upon. Every few minutes, the top requested song is queued into the party playlist.How We Built ItWe built Aux using Spotify's API and a Flask server.Challenges We Ran IntoThe Python API wrapper we used, Spotipy, made it difficult to get authorization for the host account in an elegant way.AccomplishmentsWe accomplished so much this weekend: running a server locally, accessing and generating a user playlist, and implementing a live voting and priority queue system.What We LearnedOur group has learned a lot about front and back-end development, specifically experimenting with JS, Angular.js (although unsuccessful), and Flask. We also became more experienced in live API integration, including dealing with poorly documented features.What's Next for AuxNext, Aux has to be cleaned up and become more presentable. After this point, it can begin to be scaled to allow many hosts and parties to be occurring simultaneously. Additionally, we would like to implement 'global parties' with public playlists connecting people worldwide. We also would like to implement web player capabilities to keep our entire application in one location.Built Withcss3flaskhtml5pythonspotifyTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    McHacks 2017    Created by  Integrated Spotify API in Flask and PythonAndrew McCannProblem solver looking for problems to solve.Backend - Routing               - Flask server setupFrontend - Jinja2Samar SajnaniSangeet ParasharMathew Abado 
  
 I've always loved the idea of writing an AI bot to challenge or fight others. I think it's a super fun way to learn to program and feels empowering. I always wanted to host a "St. Olaf vs Carleton Bot Wars" sort of thing, but none of the available tools really make it easy. That's mainly because:You can't challenge individual people or groups. You can only upload your code to fight in the global leaderboards.You can't easily play the game as a human, or play against your own bot as a human player.Most games are grid-based. (Which is ideal for developing AI, but is often not what the real world looks/feels like)So I set out to make something that should be: simple, flexible and tangible. I wanted something that does not obscure the process of writing code. No one writes a perfect algorithm from scratch on their first try. Programming is an iterative process. It's very important for beginners to see that to understand how talented programmers do what they do and how they got to where they are. * My tool will be highlighting, rather than obscuring, the process of writing code.*

 Adaptavist Test Management for JIRA Server is a product that Adaptavist believe is the best option for Test & QA teams looking to manage their testing within JIRA.We have had lots of interest from Test & QA teams who are using JIRA Cloud and have sadly until now had to end their interest in our solution once we discover they are not using JIRA Server or JIRA Data Centre. We wanted to change that and provide the features customers wanted in a Test Management solution for JIRA Cloud.

 The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.-- Donald Knuth (Computer Programming as an Art; 1974; page 671)When optimizing C++ code I made heavy use of profiling tools. This gave me insights on which lines of code the running time is spend. More often than not, this was not in the place where I expected it to be.Solidity is only different in the metric. We are not interested in time, but in gas cost. 
 Refugee women often fill a domestic role when they arrive in Australia, managing the home, looking after the children and cooking the meals. In addition to preventing those women from attending language classes, this results in social isolation and a widening gender gap. 
  
 During our internship at a utility industry, we build software that supports many fields workers. These are folks whose work may include performing inspections and repairs in potentially hazardous environments. Most of the software we’ve been developing aids these folks from a productivity standpoint by improving how they perform their work.However, we’ve noticed that nothing really supports them from a safety perspective. They are required to take safety-training courses and acquire certifications, which are useful, but as a team, we started thinking about how could software be used to improve worker safety.  We noticed that sometimes field workers working in hazardous conditions are not able to focus on safety while they are working on their assigned work. For example, a construction worker working near a Gas Pipeline may not able to sense minor gas leaks as he/she is focused on their assigned task. This can cause loss of life and property.Work Safety Management System is our attempt at addressing this problem. 
 I am an RA for one of the freshman dorms, and I have seen my residents go through a lot of struggle during their first year of college. Most common problems being financial hardships, relationship issues, anxiety, class load and soon.  Sometimes, students share their problems but a lot of times they hesitate to talk about any of this topic, and thus don't get any emotional support. So, I created Chitthi, a personal RA, with whom you can share any of your problems and she is going to respond you with the solution to your problem.  
 We saw the brand new Samsung Family Hub smart fridge at the CES 2017, which require manual data log-in for the goods stored inside. We got inspired to create a smart fridge that can automatically log in what's inside the fridge, enable users to access the data remotely and have information recommended for the users based on what they have in the fridge. 
 The idea came thanks to a Twitch Streamer, Snugibun, who started the whole movement for getting captions available for everyone on twitch, but, while the intention was great, I noticed two main problems:  1 - The captions were burned in the video, which meant that getting the original video would be impossible, while re-captioning a video is pretty doable.  2 - Due to them being burned in the stream, they could not be enlarged or moved by the user and also lacked any form of transparency.So I decided to try and find a solution for these problems.

 Biking in Boston is intense!  Boston drivers are mean people and they don't like bikes!With biking being so dangerous in the area, the goal was to improve safety and visibility of bikers.  Many drivers are unfamiliar with hand signals that bikers use to slow down or turn.  On top of that, most bikers don't even use the signals!The goal was to be able to adapt visibility biking lights to light up for braking and to signal for turns.  With better lighting, bikers do not have to worry about the distraction of making a hand signal.  Drivers will also easily understand the biker's intent. 
 For many organizations, JIRA is a major tool for IT, business and development teams to operate their functions. Collecting all integrations in JIRA gives teams power to react quickly on the changing trends of business operations.AWS is a central tool for lots of companies. We believe that bringing these two products together will enable businesses for better control and faster growth. 
 Tobii is the world leader in eye tracking technology. Founded in 2001, the company has built its reputation on providing millions of families with the tools it needs in order to better communicate. Eye tracking was born as a research tool, but soon exploded in the specialty market where users were able to communicate using our products (Watch Sebastian Story). Since then we have uncovered countless uses for this technology.The inspiration for Tobii Ghost came about whilst watching speech tablet users, We soon realized that we were trying to guess what they were trying to say just before they actually said it, giving us a visual representation of user intention.With this thought formed and being avid gamers ourselves, we began toying with the idea with the belief that this had great potential ONLY IF we were able to have a good visualization tool to display exactly where and what a person is looking at.Challenges we ran intoBack then we didn’t have a good visualization tool for eye movements on screen. However, there did exist a lot of experiments such as Dwell-Free that allowed us to trace a succession of actions based on heat maps. Whilst innovative, it wasn’t really suited to gaming. We needed something less intrusive and based on what we experienced, heatmaps were a step in the right direction in terms of achieving fluency.So, we accelerated the decay of the heatmap and that created a kind of a waterdrop effect in the screen (The first bubble!). We then created a different variation of that technique that ended up being the customization feature in our extension. After that things gathered steam. We showcased the functionality to Eleague and we were promoted in a  "Getting Technical" segment that became quite popular in the show. After that (by content creators/streamers request), we made this a streaming tool. Accomplishments that we are proud ofThe 2nd challenge came when we had the option to transform this streaming tool as an extension, by that time twitch was working in a new version of their extension store showcasing a new way of visualizing extensions in categories,  that will boost discovery for newcomers. Of course, we did not want to lose this opportunity, but we had 3 weeks to research how to build this and actually do it!Also, we have no branding at all, we call it internally the "Gaze overlay", so we had to have that in mind too and what was more difficult by then: "How we can help our users to explain to their viewers that the bubble means eye tracking?". It was a huge challenge, a very exciting one with a lot of office hour but also with a ton of fun since we were doing something that no one has seen before in gaming and/or eye tracking :) We have seen an amazing reception that been translated into a great exponential organic growth. This has not only allowed us to expand in streamers numbers but also has open doors in esports events as a broadcasting tool: Rainbow Six US Invitationals   
 After reading the news and learning that 63 million people are faced with poverty every year in India due to healthcare expenditure alone, I was shocked. I had worked with image recognition and machine learning before so I set out to solve this problem in my own way. 
 Personally, I am a pretty disorganized, and even tools such as planners prove to be useless to me because I often just forget to check the planner, and other reminder systems are either not intelligent enough or are a hassle to set up. I have tried everything from google calendar to trello, and all of the other time management systems, and they just dont work efficiently enough. Google Calendar notifications get annoying and repetitive to the point where they can be ignored, etc. Thats why, we set out to create a time management app like no other. 
 Hi we're the {Set} Protocol team. We've been building out the Set abstraction for ERC20 tokens so that we can group together tokens and transact in batches.  This provides convenience and gas-savings and we thought we could apply the similar idea for ERC721 tokens.  The first thing that came to mind was being able to create "Booster Packs" (similar to Magic: The Gathering or Pokemon cards) of non-fungible tokens.  We started with the famous CryptoKitties as an example, but this could theoretically be applied to any group of ERC721 tokens and be traded around as a single token. 
 As high school students who frequently discuss the sciences or mathematics with our peers or with other students who need tutoring, we found that this was very hard to do over Facebook Messenger due to its inability to recognize LaTeX text. Quite often, this process requires the hassle of going to other websites to get screenshots of LaTeX formatted equations before sending them through the chat system. Being able to integrate LaTeX recognition into Facebook Messenger itself eliminates this problem. 
  
  
 Traditionally when patients leave in-patient care, they are sent home with a long and incomprehensible set of printed instructions for at-home care. The information provided is not organized or designed with regard to the patient's perspective and leads to many problems.This outdated format limits the patient and their caretakers' access to important information about prescriptions, daily therapy regiments, and the course of their recovery.For many diseases, preventing future medical emergencies is key. For example, patients that have suffered a stroke are at an increased risk of experiencing another in the first year. After leaving the hospital, these patients need to follow a strict regiment of medication and therapy. Without patients' thorough understanding of their disease and its treatment, the risk of suffering a second stroke is increased.Another major drawback of the traditional format of patient education is the lack of dialogue between patients and their healthcare providers. If patients have questions and concerns, they will have to call through the hospital or wait until their next scheduled appointment, which can often be months away. Patients slowly lose control of their healthcare, which can lead to serious issues in mental health and hinder their recovery.With this app, we hope to better prepare patients and their loved ones for the transition back to a healthy life and empower them to control their own healthcare. 
 I was first inspired to create a Twitch Extension like this when attending a panel by Suz Hinton (@noopkat) at Twitch Con 2017. She mentioned she was an advocate for accessibility on the web and wanted to try doing Closed Captioning on Twitch. This seeded the idea in my mind and I had it in the back of my head for a long time. Before the hackathon I started to notice broadcasters using a Closed Captioning browser source in their OBS setups, a simple section on their stream overlays dedicated to displaying speech to text closed captioning for their viewer. Seeing this rekindled the idea in the back of my mind and when the call went out for this hackathon I thought that the time was right to tackle trying to do the same but doing it as a Twitch extension video overlay that will be configurable and increase user engagement. 
  
  
 Our inspiration came from the Mobile Game "Space Team", one of our favorite co-op mobile Games. BizDev Meeting takes the mechanic of "Space Team" and 'turns it up a notch' with BizDev lingo and a Business-Meeting Role-Play scenario.How we built itUsing Meteor.Challenges we ran intoIt was challenging to get some of the UI components done toward the end of the evening, so we decided to cut some components out for submission. A lot of code did not get refactored to save time. Despite challenges towards the end of the evening, building the core codebase was a relatively smooth process.The game was designed to look like a Windows95 Mobile App... (if Mobile Apps were actually a thing back then). It was oddly very challenging to achieve the styles of a non-styled HTML4 table (on the Game Win screen), since table attributes are not supported in HTML5. (lol). It was fun to purposefully design and build the game to feel and look old...on purpose.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe got the majority of the app running pretty quickly, and despite small issues that came up toward the end of the evening, it was fairly simple. Our team really enjoyed working together.What's next for BizDev MeetingI think we will finish up some of the ui components to the game is fully playable, and so that we can test it amongst our bizdev friends.Built Withcron-tickflash-messagesiron-routermoment.jsreactive-varscsstimesyncTry it outbizdev-20.meteor.comgithub.com      Submitted to    Meteor Global Distributed Hackathon     Created by  Worked on doodads.Brandon Baris!!Design, General UX Typography & Layout StylingKelli BorgoniaGame Architecture & LogicJon BorgoniaBuild UI to match windows 95Emmanuel Pilande

 It started as an effort to help a friend who needed a microSD card to load a custom Linux image for his Raspberry Pi. I gave him my card, and he backed up all the data, and then attempted to format it using dd.It did not work.

 We have many companies that are missing an easy and smooth way to brand themselves in their Microsoft Outlook emails. Today they only have one branding space which is the autosignature function. The challenge with the autosignature is that it appears at the bottom and while we are reading our emails on mobile devices we more often wont come down to the bottom of the email. If we have our subscriptionlink, Social Media links, videolinks etc. here the brand value is decreasing.  Furthermore there is many companies who wants to streamline their daily email communication with their own design.Saving time in all aspects is crucial for all companies and saving time is meaning saving money. 
 My inspiration was ScreenSnipe - a JIRA and Confluence plugin we recently archived on the Atlassian Marketplace. ScrenSnipe was developed with Java Applets technology which is almost dead now, hence my idea to create a new plugin in pure HTML5. The first version is for JIRA Server with essential functionalies. Plans we evaluate revolve around JIRA Cloud and Confluence versions.

 Chat Heroes came about after spending approximately 3 years on the Twitch platform. While we were able to meet and chat with new people, we still felt limited in the ability to express ourselves. Twitch brought games to life, and now Chat Heroes brings chat to life.

 A friend of mine told me about the Amazon Multimodal Contest, #AmazonAlexaMultimodalChallenge, and I thought I'd take a stab at making my first Alexa Skill.  While researching the Amazon Presentation Language I looked for inspiration in my daily life to guide my direction.  One evening, my family and I were trying to decide on what movie we would watch.  This sparked the idea of a fun and interactive decision maker.  Thus was born, "Fork On The Road".

 Think of any event we go to or any place we go to. There are hundreds and thousands of people. How can we find out who we should connect with or if there are any people worth connecting nearby? We all have that problem. Likemind solves that problem. How it works Given your location, we find nearby tweets and the users who tweeted them  We generate a user's personality using IBM's Personality Insight API on user tweets  We generate a user's interests using Alchemy's keyword extraction API on user tweets and profile  Then we match you against each of the nearby users on personality match and interest match scores Challenges we ran intoSpeed is an issue, since we have to collect users nearby, then collect tweets for those users on real-time. Twitter also has very rigid restrictions on usage. We ended up using ~150 tweets per user for this demo to solve both the speed and twitter restriction problem. Automatically extracting user interests from twitter profile is also challenging. We tried a few of Alchemy API's services, but the problem was they were not very good for tweets. Then we used the keyword service, which returns some garbage, but we did some additional filtering and it ended up being very useful. iOS is a difficult platform to prototype onAccomplishments that we're proud ofWe successfully managed to overcome the challenges of collecting nearby user profiles and finding matches pretty well. We had many exciting feature ideas, we managed very well to define the MVP and execute it in time.

 Wanted to enable continuous monitoring of mental health for patients with Anxiety Disorders. 
 Our team members are hyped about Machine Learning and UX. We were intrigued by the Sohjoa virtual bus stops challenge. It allowed us to design a bus service we would love to use ourselves: a cheap but efficient alternative for the taxi/uber. We wanted to hack a bunch of state of the art tech together to show how a dynamic bus service could work.The problemEvent organizers have trouble getting their attendees to the event venue. Public transportation may not be enough and organizing custom transportation is expensive and time-consuming. The best practice for custom transportation so far is to organize a route from a pre-defined point X to the venue using a pre-defined schedule. The customers will still have to travel to point X before they can use the arranged transportation. They will have to schedule their day based on the transportation's schedule. If they don't want to deal with these problems they can choose to use their own car or get a taxi/UBER, which gets expensive really fast.  Technically, this kind of problem is often referred to as the last mile problem. We wanted to tackle a variation of this: the first mile problem. Even with just some tens of passengers there are millions of possible routes between them, let alone when a third variable, time, is taken into account.The solutionOur project for Junction 2016 aims to solve the transportation problem by using Sohjoa to organize dynamic and cost controlled custom transportation. Our concept is a tool for event organizers and public transportation decision makers that allows them to design dynamic routing for the self-driving bus. If the surroundings of a location are pre-scanned the bus can plan and drive routes that are planned on-the-go.  Our tool makes the required optimizations to the route, chooses a smart way to transport people from their desired pick-up location and tells Sohjoa which route and schedule to follow during the transportation. The use cases1) Event transportationEvents organize group transportation to boost visitor counts. Doing this in a cost efficient way is what really matters. Unlike public transportation there is a more clear business model: people bring in money, so it is worth investing money to bring them to the event. Our routing algorithm allows prioritization by cost, which means that people can be transported on a price per visitor basis.2) The commuter's first mileCurrently public transportation is organized around node points such as railway or metro stations. However, the last mile or so is often the most unconvinient for a commuter. Busses to less populated areas leave seldomly and can't stop at everyones home. Our service can create efficient routes that transport everyone from and to the general area of their home - adjusting dynamically to demand thus being able to take the shortest route to the destination.  The techThe service is running on a node.js server, with React and Redux used for the web UI. Our algorithms are written in Python so we can leverage state of the art Machine Learning libraries.1) Clustering user data  - Recursive DBSCAN machine learning algorithm to reduce the complexity of the spacetime data.2) Sjukstra routing  - Customized Djikstra that takes into account cost-factors that are specific to electric buses3) Routing with EMBERS  - Leveraging Embers route planning to get fast routes between virtual bus stops4) Data visualisation with leaflet  - Intuitive and easy to use planning and visualisation tool for virtual bus stops5) Telegram (SujuBot) end user demo  - Example of an end user UI. Helps envision how the service would look for an end user.  AccomplishmentsThe project required long hours and took our very best effort. In the end, even though at times we had problems and didn't always feel like we were progressing, we were able to create a prototype of a service that helps better imagine what is possible and how shared transportation could work. We have coded through the entire night and currently have our fingers crossed that our pitcher will stay awake through Sunday.Our main challenges were parametrizing and developing algorithms to solve the initial routing problem, we had to develop them almost from scratch. Integrating our different parts to a seamless and consistent service took lots of time and effort. Lastly, it was difficult to prioritize and scope a presentable MVP, the problem was complex and had numerous points of possible failure.What's nextOur project is left open ended. It could be taken towards multiple of development directions, but only time will tell. We hope that during the judging phase we will get inspiring suggestions or feedback on our project.Built Withazuredbscanemberses6leaflet.jsnode.jsnumpypostgresqlpythonradixreactreduxsassscikit-learntelegramTry it outsuju.onlinegithub.com      Submitted to    Junction 2016Winner                Main Prize              Winner                Embers Challenge              Winner                Sohjoa Robotbus Challenge              Winner                Track Finalists                  Created by  Deployed code to server, consulted algorithms and added very small touches on the frontend.Aleksi JokelaI developed some front endJere VaaraThe mom of the team.

Whatever way you choose, you will still find yourself linking that person on more social media afterwards. Why not do it in one go with an easy-to-use app?What if you have to meet new people for business all the time? Then, your life turns into endless flow of business cards with no real structure and a simple way to organise it! Our app aims to become your electronic business card library and your business card on the go: search both your home and work contacts easily and have your business card with you wherever you go. Avoid the hassle with paper business cards!How it worksA person downloads an app and goes through a simple sign-up process that allows to add personal and work contacts like Facebook, LinkedIn etc. (only Email Address is implemented right now). Afterwards, the person takes a personal picture to be used for face recognition (in future, the Face Recognition library will be also filled up with profile images from added social networks). Ready to go!Recognising someone and adding a their contacts is as easy as taking a picture of that person!Challenges we ran intoFace recognition doesn't really work well - different camera configurations, different lighting or even haircut and glasses screwed up the process. Thus, in the future, we need to add more reliable identification techniques like Fingerprint recognition (when the devices are equipped appropriately) with a fallback to techniques like NFC, Bluetooth or QR Code scanning.Having a centralised server for all the functionality means that we can roll out updates and have total control over the core of our app. However, it also means that the app can't function offline or if the server goes down. Meanwhile, doing Face recognition on the device is difficult due to all the SDKs out there (some of which are limited to the processor chips, e.g., Snapdragon SDK).Using Ionic and Cordova for making an app was a really good choice due to rapid view design process, but the framework sometimes behaves unexpectedly on the actual device. Lack of on-device JavaScript debugging makes development quite a horrifying process.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe were advised to have a look at Parse backend-as-a-service and it worked out really great for us. Our backend server is just a single file with less than 250 lines of code!Doing a complex app that interacts with a server, uses camera and Face recognition only by means of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript is exciting and is quite an accomplishment on its own. A couple of years ago we never could imagine using thick technology stack in such a way!What we learnedWe had no prior experience in Ionic or Face recognition, so we learnt a great deal. We applied Ionic framework to bootstrap a simple cross-platform app really quickly. We discovered Parse - great alternative to managing your own database. We figured out the ins and outs of Face recognition with current technologies.What's next for Ice BreakerRefactoring! And lots of it! App in it's current state is very much a fragile prototype, so we need to improve it's code quality. Changing the app engine from Ionic to something like Xamarin.Forms (more native yet still cross-platform) will improve the performance and may give us a chance to use the some on-device Face recognition techniques.Adding more contact sources will always remain needed (especially right now, when we only have a single email) - integration with all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ (for personal contacts) and LinkedIn (for work contacts) is crucial.What if you already have a collection of Business Cards? We could use Artificial Intelligence to smartly recognise your collection of paper Business Cards and automatically create an electronic entry with all the details (Name, Email, Age etc.)Limiting ourselves to Business Cards for people is quite boring! We could use the renowned iBeacon technology to implement Business Cards for Places.

 One of the largest pain points of going to any event is the registration or checkin lineup.One of the main problems is that the registration people have to flip through reams of paper trying to find the person's name. While the event may be organized, the anti-pattern that happens is when the event organizers try to print out the spreadsheet of their guests/attendees.Reconciling paper is tedious and error-prone.Event Organizers can try to share it via the Share function for Excel. But smartphones and tablets were not really meant for Excel spreadsheet.. It's also difficult for staff/users to search and update records.What organizers really need is some sort of way to share the spreadsheet, maintain control but allow maximum efficiency and collaboration. Like the tools that exists for sharing images (imgur.com) or links (bit.ly), but designed for spreadsheets and tabular information.

 A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business.Henry FordWe weren't inspired by some life-changing experience, or by a vision to be the greatest in all of history.As students, we wanted more from our grade data. So we created the first solution.How it worksThe best way to experiment is through daily utility -- so that'sexactly how we've setup our first version.The first version of The Gradebook is built as an extension of the learning information platform Infinite Campus. In setting our application up this way, we can access existing student data, building up our platform on a system that our own school uses to store grade data.When a student signs into their school portal, we use the existing API to download all of their grade data, then we reorganize it in a way that makes it more visually pleasing, easier to understand, and more navigable.FunctionalityTheoretical Grading: Your grading platform should extend beyond the present -- we make that happen. With theoretical grading, you can add in future grades to see how it would affect your existing grade. Don't get blindsided by critical grade dumps that change your grade.Built-In Notifications: When you open the application, you're presented with any new updates to your grades. Click on any notification to immediately scroll to that class.Beautiful User Interface: Our user interface minimizes convolution while focusing on what matters most. The app is just a frame, your grades are the real content.Faster Refresh Rates: Because we solely focus on grades, we can grab your data faster. As soon as we have all of your raw grade data, we cut off the stream, minimizing data usage and maximizing download times. No extra student information is downloaded, giving us an edge over traditional platforms.Extreme Ubiquity: Our app is available on iOS and Android, with user interfaces specific to each platform. Download it at grdbk.comChallengesSince there aren't any other products in our market, we had to paveour own path.Information Learning SystemThe world of student gradebook data is a battle of the big companies: Powerschool, Infinite Campus, and many other solutions are going to head-to-head with claims over parts of the American education system. That level of fragmentation made it hard to determine where to start. Since our school,  Adlai E. Stevenson High School, uses Infinite Campus, we started with that.Initial RoleOur end goal is to provide broad-variety analytics to both students and teachers regarding overall trends in classes based on the teacher, the school, and pretty much any other possible filter. But that's a bit macroscopic -- so we started small.We decided to start off by just helping students make sense of where their grades are, and where they could be heading. Therefore we built a system that can grab student data and then provide theoretical grading.Student PrivacyStudent data has to be handled extremely responsibly, so we've done our best not to overstep. All data is solely stored locally and all calculations are done on the device in real-time. We want to shift over to a server (in beta), but we want more help and to invest more time into developing a secure server-client infrastructure first.Bug FixesWe have a small team of 3 active students, balancing our coding lives with all of our extracurriculars and academics. We often find ourselves staying up late trying to solve bugs only to find out there are more that have been discovered. Everyone is in extremely unique grading situations, and we often find ourselves tweaking our code to deal with unanticipated situations.DemographicsThough our market is the entire student population in America, we can't reach them all at once. For now, we've limited our marketing and setup to our school community: Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois. We want to continue to expand outside of our community, and to move onto different information learning systems so we can access people who don't use Infinite Campus as well.AccomplishmentsCreated the first real student analytic platformCompleted our application & pushed it to the market in under 6 monthsFollowed up the iOS version with an Android version in under 3 monthsUsed by 50% of potential demographic (local school population of 4000+)News coverage in local school paper with interviewLessons LearnedBefore pushing to market, the beta process is extremely importantDesign the UI carefully, changing it radically post-release disturbs user comfortWhen someone asks for a feature, adding it makes them a loyal userConsistent updates keep users happyLoyal/happy users recommend your software to friendsUnorganized code inhibits code scalabilityUp NextThe Gradebook is still in its infancy.

 The inspiration came to us when Chris gave the introductory note on the work they are doing at HomeBase. This was followed with a small conversation where we spoke to Chris about all different tasks they plan to complete on IoT for example triggering a coffee machine with the alarm you set to wake yourself up. Me and my teammate spent next few hours discussing different ideas and studying how existing models are working. As this is the Tornado season at Manhattan we decided to go ahead with the idea to create a weather Alert system using existing hardware and APIs. How we built itWe spent initial hours discussing various interesting ideas we came up with and wrote designs for few of them. This was followed by feasibility discussion of these ideas :D . Finally we decided to work on weather Alert system. After finalizing the design we decided to make a mobile application. It was getting difficult to decide platforms to work and therefore we came up with an idea of a web-based application.  We wrote the code on HTML and PHP and used LIFX and OpenWeatherMap APIs . We have implemented following functionalities.Switching Lights On/OffSetting lights to desired colors.Control brightness of the light.Implemented Special Effects - Pulse effectsWeather Alert - This is the most vital functionality. Using current user location (Longitude and Latitude ) we fetch data from OpenWeatherMap. This returns JSON data with different details about weather. There are three major categories of weather status returned - Clouds , Rain and Clear. When status is "Rain" we invoke a pulse notification with Blue color that notifies user of Rain. If the weather status is Clouds we give a mild purple color pulse. This indications help user to stay updated without looking at their digital devices. As this is a visual stimulus it quickly grabs user attention and saves them from missing any update (SMS or alarms can be overlooked if they are silent or in other rooms). These alerts then help users in planning their schedules such as - meetings or travels. As, this is a web based application so it can be easily modified into an i-OS or android based mobile application. Demos - https://youtu.be/nSY-xDraPCEhttps://youtu.be/JAF_W9bzmV4Challenges we ran intoWe came up with several ideas initially but the biggest hurdle we ran was hardware to test the implementation. Also, there are no online simulators and very limited API for devices. Accomplishments that we're proud ofThis was our first Hackathon and this was a great experience. We are proud that we were able to come up with a submission for our first Hackathon.What we learnedWe had very limited knowledge about Internet of Things, IoT is a buzz word and touted to be the future we did not have any exposure in this area. Hack k-state has given us an opportunity to learn and understand IoT.What's next for HomeBase_WeatherAlert We plan to extend weather updates to alerts such as Firewatch, Tornadoes etc.  Extend the application to work with other home appliances , for example coffee makers and geysers with alarms, fitness bands with Refrigerators etc. We will integrate these appliances to monitor their energy consumption and optimize energy usage and reduce electricity bills.Built Withcsshtml5jquerylifxopenweathermapphpTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    Hack K-State    Created by  Teammate in this projectShubh ChopraDhananjay Mehta

 Anatomy is considered as one of the most comprehensive topics which often challenge students in general. Learning anatomy is difficult as it usually costs significant time and effort to memorize and comprehend. Our MedReality website provides an impactful solution to increase lively study environment and promote students imagination in learning anatomy. MedReality is a virtual reality website providing students exclusive experiences including several vibrant and descriptive anatomical lessons in both human and animals. Our inspiration is to allow students to both train by themselves and in groups, as multiple users can join a virtual space and experience a human and animal anatomy demonstration.Additionally, this framework is deployed with an AI system which was trained on a cloud using human expert ground truth. The system's purpose is able to assist disease diagnosis,  medical imaging segmentation or even quantification.

 Enviro aims to connect people who wish to do something for the environment on a common app based platform. The app connects users living in the same neighborhood based on zip code and lets them post an environmental issue that affects local residents , also host events which can bring them together . The chat option and point based ranking system motivates them to be engaged with each other and thereby do their bit for the environment collectively.FeaturesIssue reporting platformEnviro lets users post a picture and add a small description about an environmental hazard in his vicinity . The photo and description is visible to all users nearby and anyone can share it with the concerned officials and also view the exact location . Once the issue is resolved , the reporter can close the issue himself or any other user can send him a issue close request and thereby close fixed issues.Event hosting platformWith Enviro users can host environmental events at a common public place with a predefined date and time. Other users from the same vicinity can view the events and RSVP to the same.ChatChat about events , issues with the nearest Enviro users and collaborate online to transform single person movements to groups and thereby make a substantially larger impact. It can also be used to form carpooling groups , common nature preservation events , organize talks and take measures to curb various types of pollution.Point based leader-boardA leader-board based on points to inject a positive competitive spirit among users and thereby induce continuous activity on the environment and app which also inspires other users to follow suit300 points on signing up.50 points for every new issue reported.20 points for hosting an event.15 points for joining an event.2 points for sending a message.How we built itWe built it using Android studio and Parse as the backend for content and activity .Challenges we ran intoImplementing location based filtering and chat Accomplishments that we're proud ofNew issue reporting , events and chat functionality is stable . Point system is working like a charm and the app uses minimal memory and data. The developers were in two continents and the collaboration part went smooth and quick and involved exactly 10 git commits . What's next for EnviroThe app needs to go deep into users , maybe also tweak the points algorithm to better rank users . Get feedback from users and turn the app into a market ready app with improved UI/UX , performance and options .

 “Charity begins at home, and should not end there.”- UnknownCertain NGOs and religious establishments cater to poor or underprivileged people by giving away used good quality household items.These organizations are key part of helping in the betterment of the society. Due to an absence of an online system that can keep track of the demand and supply of used items, these requests usually take long to get fulfilled. This inspired us to fill that gap and build an app that can help these organizations and the people who need them.

 There is no better place to collaborate and create great content than Confluence. I wanted to use Confluence for internal company work and also for creating and updating the public company website and product documentation. Using Confluence for both means the team has one tool to learn, a great content editor, comments and collaboration, and all the other goodies Confluence provides.While I could point customers to a Confluence Cloud instance I wanted a super fast and responsive website so customers get what they are looking for as quickly as possible, making them happier. I also wanted pretty URLs (https://arijea.com/ vs https://arijea.atlassian.net/, for example).Bringing these things together led to the creation of Instant Websites for Confluence.

 Office Floor Plan Navigator was inspired by the need to solve the problem of locating people, meeting rooms, etc. within an indoor setting.  There are a plethora of mapping systems for the outdoor world, so, why not create a mapping system for the indoor world?What?Office Floor Plan Navigator takes indoor building floor plans and turns them into an interactive mapping platform allowing you to assign a location to anything from your favorite pen to a meeting room. How?Office Floor Plan Navigator is built using an open source web based Geographic Information System (GIS) JavaScript framework. To retrieve data from Office 365, we use the Microsoft Graph API to pull user profile data including the thumbnail image. The Microsoft Graph API is called via PHP.  Assign a unique ID (add to any Azure AD field) to a desk, printer or meeting room, then, use Office Floor Plan Navigator to attach an XY coordinate to the ID.  Then, query the Azure AD for a person etc and Office Floor Plan Navigator will zoom to the corresponding XY location on the office floor plan and bring up their profile details.The custom SharePoint Employee Directory is built via ASP.net.  The embedded Office Floor Plan Navigator employs the use of a SharePoint web part and an iframe.Challenges?A couple of technical glitches were encountered when registering the application.  Permission to read user profiles did not appear to  be granted.  After much random clicking this was resolved.Also, one annoyance discovered was the lack of profile information integration between Azure AD,  Office 365 user manager, and SharePoint Online.

 I believe many organisation has not adopted SharePoint Online in Office 365 because it is simply to complicated to access when you want to save or find content. As most of the information we get today are on mail, this should be avilable directly from the mail client. In additions, when ever a O365 Group, Planner, or Team is created a Group site is created. Saving files and or e-mails into these sites should be easy and done directly from Outlook on any device.A simple way of saving email and attachments from Outlook to SharePoint Online and Group sites.

 To contrast the surge in demand for language education spurred by the current refugee crisis, affected countries are training a surplus of instructors and teachers who's employment will only last 5-10 years due to the transient nature of the crisis - not a sustainable workforce, unfortunately. Education is one of the major costs in the integration and inclusion of refugees, and once successful, it will invalidate the thousands of teachers and skill hours developed to contrast the temporary crisis. Countries like Germany and Sweden are turning to automation - Germany for example, developed an official app for refugee language education, and is using $5,000 NAO robots to supplement education supervised by teachers. 
 "Last year, I was in Dharavi, the largest slum in India. Being an informal community, residents cannot rely on the government to provide for them so any initiatives in the community need to be self led. For instance, there was a well in this community used to be a source of life for locals, providing for irrigation and personal use. However, since it became polluted, it can no longer be used and it has remained this way for years. With our commUnity app, a proactive individual can lead the way in getting residents to collaborate in restoring the well to its former glory. This is just one type of use case, with commUnity being a great platform for organizing social community events and philanthropic initiatives." -William 
 Today, the biggest challenge is to achieve a faster and more reliable close, and many departments are waking up to the fact that they need a reporting solution with the functionality to meet growing complexity.

This approval activity can at times get really tedious and be prone to human errors.  
 I was inspired by the innovative tools that I was learning about at the most recent AWS Summit here in New York (Checkout the presentations on SlideShare and Youtube if you haven't already.)I knew that I wanted to use AWS Lambda to run "Event-Driven Code in the Cloud" as they put it, and when they showed us how simple it was to create an HTTP endpoint for your Lambda functions the first thing that sprung to mind was a scraper that would take Devpost pages and return JSON.How it worksIt's a little quirky to work with since you'll need to make POST requests in order to retrieve your data as JSON, since the new API Gateway/Lambda combination doesn't seem to have anyway to support URL parameters yet. Here is the example CURL command I would execute to scrape my portfolio:$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"screen_name":"MGerrior"}' https://iii3mdppm7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/UserPortfolioEndpointObviously you will want to replace my screen name with your screen name to obtain data related to you. It's not built as a crawler yet, so it will only return information that is visible when you first view your portfolio on Devpost.The API uses Amazon's new API Gateway that provides built in caching and throttling out of the box. The API endpoint is the hooked up to a Lambda function that is executed when the request is received. The Lambda function then scrapes the page, formats it as a JSON response, and returns it to the API Gateway which subsequently returns it to you.Challenges I ran intoOne of the challenges that I ran into was finding resources for learning how to work with these tools. They're both fairly new services (API Gateway was just announced at the summit a week ago), so finding resources online outside of the official docs was not easy. I additionally ran into some issues with the Grunt tasks I was using from grunt-aws-lambda since it was producing empty zip files for me to upload to Lambda, but I eventually just zipped the files myself.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofI'm pretty proud that I was able to get this up and running in just a few hours as part of Dev Thursday here at Devpost.What I learnedI learned that I hate writing Java. As of right now AWS Lambda mainly supports two runtime environments which are node.js and Java. I couldn't figure out how to get NPM modules loaded in Lambda (Save yourself some time, just read this) so I decide I would just use Java instead and take advantage of all the built-in libraries, or so I thought. After struggling with Eclipse, and then struggling to install the AWS SDK for Eclipse (something something Data Tools Platform?), I switched back to node.js and bundled the npm modules as a ZIP file thanks to the guide above.What's next for Unofficial Devpost APII want to figure out how to add CORS headers to the responses from the API Gateway so that developers on Devpost can integrate this data into third party sites such as their portfolio by doing something as simple as:$.post("https://iii3mdppm7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/UserPortfolioEndpoint", {screen_name: "MGerrior"}, function(data) {  // Add your projects to the DOM});If you try that right now the request will fail for security purposes since the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is not set in the response.Also, it wouldn't hurt for this to have more endpoints, or to just build an actual API for Devpost.Built Withamazon-web-servicesaws-api-gatewayaws-lambdacheerio.jsgrunt-aws-lambdagrunt.jshtmljavascriptnode.jsnpmrequest      Submitted to    Your First API | Summer Jam    Created by  Matthew GerriorSenior Software Engineer @ Devpost 
  
  
  
 The genius behind Summer Jam is Richard. He came up with the idea of a series of online hackathons throughout the summer and recruited an internal team to help him get it off the ground. We all went to summer camp as kids, and Richard encouraged us to use that theme on the landing page and overall branding. Holly came up with the fabulous logo and color scheme, while Neal knocked out a basic landing page and steered the team towards the Jam / Jamboree language. Once we had a basic page, Holly went back and rewrote all of Neal's hacky CSS and created high-res assets mobile. Keeping it leanWe chose to keep the stack light, relying on only Pure, retina.js, and google fonts. No jQuery here.We also used deep-link.js to add a mobile-only What'sApp sharing link. Neal's pretty proud of that bit.Accomplishments we're proud ofAs a small, but growing team, we have some conflicting priorities. We want to move quickly. Want to be methodical. We want to be flawless. We want to cut through red tape. And we want to get it done. We designed, wrote, and implemented the site without almost any engineering help. We hosted it on GitHub pages and setup a CNAME to map it to the summerjam.challengepost.com subdomain.This setup has allowed the Summer Jam team to make edits without leaching resources from engineering or slowing down our product development process. New copy? Neal can push it. New sponsor logos? Holly will create a new branch and merge it. We need to add Eventbrite links?

 Siyuan: Being a person who identified as a Hard of Hearing student in UW-Madison, I was aware that many people did have stereotypes against Deaf or Hard of Hearing(DHOH) people. Many people consider the DHOH community as an isolated community and they hope DHOH people could communicate with hearing people by spoke language. However, in Deaf culture, many DHOH people really enjoy communicating with others and they love to use American Sign Language (ASL) to engage in communication. Therefore, I want to use a mobile app to help people who are interested in ASL to improve their fingerspelling skills.Harry: As a person grow up with a cochlear implant, I can feel the world with sound or not. It's a very special experience and I want people to learn more about this special group. A mobile app would be a perfect platform to learn some interesting facts about the deafness, so I took Siyuan's invitation immediately when she asked me to join.Yuren: Actually, I did not meet many DHOH people before I came to Madison for undergraduate study. After I came here, I met and made friends with different people within the DHOH community. The more I get in touch with this community, the more I want to learn about it. Therefore, when Siyuan asked me whether I wanted to join her for this project, I joined without hesitation. 
 We knew from the offset that we wanted to do a hardware-based hack. We began with the several sensors available to us that could interface with the Qualcomm Dragonboard. Of particular interest were vibrational sensors. After considering our options, we settled on using a sound sensor to deduce structural integrity and composition of materials. We decided that a great way to test this technique would be with watermelons. After finding a 2004 paper that empirically demonstrated a relationship between vibrational modes and watermelon quality, we realized that this project would be feasible. While the authors of the paper conducted acoustical analyses, we decided, based on the time available to us and because we felt it was more aligned with the spirit of HackTJ, to use a neural network to differentiate watermelon quality. What It DoesWe prototyped a portable watermelon quality sensing device that delivers a sound producing impulse through a servo and records the corresponding sound. The recorded sound is fed into a trained neural network that determines whether or not the sound corresponds to a higher quality watermelon.How We Built ItFirst, we opened Qualcomm and tried to boot it up. After figuring out how to use the DragonBoard, we began researching how to use the electrical components while also making the neural network. While this was happening, we also brainstormed a procedure to gather data and prototyped an arm that would be attached to the servo, which we later 3D printed. Initially, we used a spy camera and microphone, but because it didn’t work, we switched to using a webcam. Afterward, we collected data using the sensor, fed the data into the neural network to train it, and wired up the actual apparatus.Challenges and AccomplishmentsThe microphone that came with spy camera did not function correctly; the signal obtained from the microphone was not clean, as a result, the .wav file was full of beeping noises that rendered data uselessThe 96Boards that came with Qualcomm DragonBoard was causing kernel panics on the DragonBoard; we solved this by giving the 96boards an additional USB power supplyWanted to do a project on watermelons; did not have watermelons; solved by getting watermelons3D printed arm did not fit onto servo, filed down components so that they fitOvercoming hardware issues by employing gracious professionalism among peers: borrowed camera due to nonfunctional cameraNeural network arrays did not align up: kept fiddling till workedSuccessfully collected dataArtificially created a controlled simulation for bad watermelonServo was not strong enough so we used knuckles to apply consistent sound generating impulse to the watermelonCame up with a fun and challenging project ideaWhat We LearnedHardware problems that can’t be fixedGathering and processing audio data from microphonesLearned that python code can be super annoyingUsing GitHub, transferring dataDifficult to roll watermelonsLearning how to use Qualcomm boardLibrary-specific sensors to DragonBoardImportant to be patient when debuggingWhat's Next For IoT HackTJ ProjectUpgrading hammer/servoA more comprehensive training setExpanding fruit typeCreating a more portable deviceBuilt With3d-printer5inch-hdmi-displayarduinoautodesk-fusion-360c++kuman-ky61-micro-servologitech-c920-webcam/microphonepythonqualcom-dragonboard      Submitted to    Hack TJ 6.0Winner                Best Hardware or Other Hack                  Created by  Sophia Wangrichardwang1124Jude_underscore_BShasty88 
  
 Sometimes it's hard to walk a few extra steps to the recycling bin. Sometimes we just don't know what to recycle. Sometimes we just forget. What isn't lazy, has a vast landscape of information, and doesn't forget? A computer. So why not outsource recycling to a cheap IoT recycling bin? 
 We wanted to get rid of the worry of being uncertain if our friends got home and at the same time free individuals from the responsibility of having to let people know when they've arrived at their destination. 
  
 We sought to build an app to bridge the increasing technological divide between smartphones and phones that do not have internet capabilities. As a result, we came up with SMSiri -- a tool that enables users without internet plans on their mobile devices to access the valuable data of the web via text message / SMS.

 Nous avons pensé à utiliser les capacités uniques des villes intelligentes afin de les adapter à leur environnement. En fait, nous savons tous que les villes ne sont pas tout à fait adaptées aux besoins de la planète et consomment beaucoup trop de ressources. Une façon de le faire serait de miser sur la capacité des citoyens à réduire leur empreinte de carbone. Mais comment faire? C'est ici que notre application web sera utile!Ce que l'application faitLe logiciel permet à un utilisateur de mentionner le modèle de son véhicule et ses itinéraires fréquemment empruntés. Notre logiciel calcule le nombre d'émission de carbones utilisées afin de lui démontrer son empreinte carbone liée à ses déplacements. Il pourra ensuite voir l'impact de son déplacement et pourra éventuellement, par exemple, considérer de s'acheter une voiture électrique ou prendre son vélo plus souvent.Comment nous l'avons faitNous avons, de façon générale, divisé notre projet en deux parties : Le “Front”, c’est à dire l’interface utilisateur, et le “Back”, c’est à dire les traitements et calculs nécessaires au fonctionnement de l’application. Nous utilisons des données fournies par Environnement Canada indiquant la consommation d'essence de différents modèles de voitures afin de calculer l'émission de CO2 effectué par les trajets de l'utilisateur.Les défis auxquels nous avons fait faceNous avons rencontré beaucoup d’obstacles pour choisir un sujet pertinent de projet. Nous avons aussi eu de la difficulté à choisir les technologies à utiliser.Ce qui nous rend fiersNous sommes fiers de notre persévérance qui a été grandement mise à l’épreuve et des efforts dédiés à notre passion pour l’informatique!Ce que nous avons apprisNous avons eu l’occasion d’apprendre et de perfectionner nos connaissances dans plusieurs frameworks : node.js, ruby on rails, meteor, express, postgre, angular, bootstrap.Nous avons aussi eu l'occasion de mieux comprendre le fonctionnement d'un Hackathon et cela nous sera utile dans de futurs événements.Quel est la suite pour SmartNebula?Notre application se contente actuellement d'estimer l'empreinte de carbone basée sur le transport, mais cela n'est qu'une partie de l'empreinte de carbone totale d'un individu, qui se complète par les déplacements imposés par tous les achats et services reçus par cet individu et divers autres activités. De plus, l'empreinte de carbone totale n'est aussi qu'une fraction de l'empreinte écologique totale d'une personne. Nous pouvons donc améliorer notre application en recueillant d'autres données afin de mieux évaluer les impacts écologiques de la vie de tous les jours.Built WithcsshtmljavascripttypescriptTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    HackatownWinner                Ivado                  Created by  Dominique Fauteux-ChapleauAlexandre HamelMarc-André GillAntoine Gaulin

 We came across an Internet article on Play Therapy for ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) young children. Play Theory suggests that activities that demand ADHD kids to control their movements help them maintain focus. So, we came up with an idea to implement a small yet engaging game to serve the purpose. Because everyone loves Flappy Bird, we decided to base our game on top of it. 
 1 Billion people speak English. Out of the world's 3.5 Billion people that are connected on the internet today. Only 18.9 Million of them are developers. In order for computer science to grow, the programming languages we use have to accommodate the people that are going to use them. 
 Sobr was inspired by the large amount of drunk driving accidents in the U.S. In 2017, there were 10,874 deaths due to drunk driving. Sobr aims to reduce this number by preventing intoxicated drivers from stepping behind the wheel to begin with and providing alternative methods of arriving home.What it Does?Sobr is intended to be an accompanying application for drivers to identify whether or not they are intoxicated before driving. It uses a combination of features detected through facial recognition to unlock the car, as long as the driver is classified as sober. If the driver is classified as intoxicated, a second (different) face must be provided to act as a designated driver.How We Built It?We began by scraping data off a dataset of pictures of human subjects before and after they had consumed alcohol. It was rather difficult to find quality datasets of this nature, and so, we had to make do with a small initial sample.Preprocessing DataWith small sample pool of images collected from 53 participants, we are asked to expand the datasets to avoid underfitting the data. First, we train a Haar Cascade Classifier to detect and extract facial features from the images. From there, we turned to image augmentation for machine learning experiments, based on which we write a script to arbitrarily apply 0, 1, or 2 special effects to the original 212 images. This technique of image augmentation allows us to generate a sample pool of 50,000, equally split between positive and negative samples.Research ProblemWe treat this as a binary classification problem where we identify whether or not the subject in the image is inebriated. We use iOS’s Vision API to detect the most prominent face in the input image, crop the corresponding bounding box, and feed this as the input to all our trained ML models.Prediction SystemThe first half of our prediction architecture is an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks trained on different randomly sampled subsets of the augmented dataset. We observed experimentally that using an ensemble produced a much more robust and reliable result as compared to what we obtained with a single neural network. Every neural net in the ensemble had the same architecture: We have four convolutional layers that use a 3x3 kernel, each followed by a max-pooling layer that subsamples in a 2x2 area with a 2x2 stride. We use relu activations throughout the network and a softmax activation on the last layer. We used cross entropy loss along with stochastic gradient descent to find optimal weights for the neural network. We used high-memory instances from Google Cloud Platform to train our models since we required significant amounts of RAM to do so. After training, we used CoreML’s keras-to-CoreML converter to transform our model to a format that can directly run on an iOS device.Following through with our intention to build a voting classifier out of several different models, we built a classifier out of Microsoft Cognitive Services’ Custom Vision API on the augmented image dataset. We used the General(Compact) model type and used a probability cutoff that resulted in reasonable precision and recall values.Aggregated ClassifiersWe took a simple majority vote out of all the different classifiers that we use. Because this is a binary classification problem and because we intentionally used an odd number of classifiers, there is no possibility of a tie. The input image is classified to contain an inebriated subject(or not) based upon whichever class secures the majority vote.Challenges We Ran IntoWhen augmenting our dataset, we took a single image that contained four separate images and split the image into four separate images. For each image, two of the images were classified as sober and two were classified as drunk. When doing this, two of the images were mixed, causing our data to be skewed when training our models. The odd thing was that it performed better with the incorrectly labelled data.Accomplishments That We're Proud OfSobr was able to correctly classify intoxicated faces at 90.68% on the validation set. We do not at present have a mechanism to measure the App’s performance, but it still performed relatively well in our subjective evaluation. Also, we were able to connect to the SmartCar API in order to send commands back and forth.Our dataset contained just 212 images in total and we successfully trained a deep neural network that performs well on such a small dataset.DNNs are notorious for overfitting in the presence of small datasets and we overcame this problem through rigorous data augmentation and ensembling several models.We also achieved excellent performance on a challenging deep learning task that has not been explored at all by the community in less than 24 hours.We built a complete, end-to-end iOS application that utilizes the ML models that we built.What We've LearnedFrom the perspective of data engineering, we practiced expanding the sample pool with limited amount of public data available. In terms of data science, we obtained experience manually constructing comprehensive dataset from scratch and came to realize the precious value behind such establishment of such enormous datasets. Lastly, it was fascinating to become aware of how computer science can contribute to novelizing a traditional concept from the past to enable for infinite potential and efficacy well beyond the status quo.What's Next for SobrFor the next steps we would like to refine the model in order to provide more accurate results. Along with this, we would like to add more components to the entire system. For example, a camera could be added to the dashboard to insure that the driver of the vehicle is not intoxicated.ReferencesHermosilla, Gabriel, et al. “Face Recognition and Drunk Classification Using Infrared Face Images.” Journal of Sensors, 2018, doi:10.1155/2018/5813514.Koukiou, G., and V.

 Why PROS?  Not long ago I met the operations director for lean manufacturer that does contract work.  When I asked him his challenges he told me there were three.  First, he told me when they reconfigure the operations floor to transition from one work order to the next, usually it impacts any number of workstations, work-centers, machines, conveyors and/or robots, etc.. Sometimes, people and/or machines aren’t always available due to the existing work orders, so they need alternative configuration plans as well. They want a tool that allows them to virtually reconfigure the operations floor for a new work order as well as any alternatives before making the physical changes.Second,  they want to simulate the work order operations (and alternative configuration plans) to forecast a new work order completion date and time.Third, they want a tool that lets them virtually configure and simulate the manufacturing operations when they add or change out equipment, alter operations or come up with new ideas to try. When we learned about the Brilliant Manufacturing Suite, we were ecstatic!  This suite gives us exactly what we need to build a solution that helps this lean manufacturer and others quickly and easily respond to dynamic operational changes virtually. Hence PROS.  
 In Germany Telekom Deutschland GmbH is the leading telecommunication operator and is transforming its land line telephone access to all IP (already 50% of its 20.2 Million Customers are migrated), which also migrates the classic voice mail system to a cloud based one. Years ago, I was one of the first migrated customers. There was no dedicated iPhone app, so I made one which reads the voicemail system, stores the messages on the phone and can play them. The login is stored in the app. So when I got the Echo and there was no skill it was natural to port my app as a skill to my echo. 
 2 months ago, my dad's former boss - Mr.Mittal -  came to Bangkok, Thailand for medical treatment. I soon found out that he suffered from motor neurone disease - a mild case of ALS specifically. I was awestruck by his condition. Just 20 years ago he ran large textile factories in Nairobi, Kenya alongside Indian businessmen. One morning, he and his wife came over to our house for breakfast. I witnessed the amount of assistance he required from his wife in order to perform basic tasks such as getting up, eating, drinking water, and even using the restroom. A few hours later, his wife decided to go to the market with my mother, leaving me alone with Mr.Mittal. Though he was able to partially move his hands and speak, most of the words came out to be gibberish. He was asking for something but I couldn't understand him. I wasn't able to ask his wife either because she would also have to guess and check what he wanted through the cell phone. After a few minutes of guessing, I finally brought him what he desired - a mere glass of water. Despite his medical condition, I was the one that felt disabled. I felt incompetent and powerless. At that moment, I realized that this was a problem worth tackling. Bridging the gap between ALS patients and their care takers was a paramount issue. I soon contacted my tech buddy - Mantej, who is extremely interested in studying biology and robotics - and decided to fix this problem!

 This idea came up when we went to the restroom. We just thought that it's really common that we want to go to the restroom but have no cash. If the restroom provider could just stick something like a QR code on the entrance, we can use Klarna service to pay for it. After that we generalized the idea to become a service that allows customers to buy anything by just scanning.  What Peasy doesPeasy provides a new and innovative mechanism for faster and more convenient payment. With Peasy, customers can purchase anything just by scanning a QRCode. Merchants can also verify payment on real time with our web service. Our system can be used for the following purposes:   Boost up and automate self-servicesPeasy can boosts up and make payment for various self-services more conveniently, such as public toilet, auto car-wash, laundry, parking, flea markets, student restaurants.Payment for customer-2-customerPeasy allows individuals to collect payment without additional payment devices. For example, if a person wants to sell their old appliance, the traditional payment way for him is by cash. With Peasy he can just generate a QR code and ask the buyer to scan the code to pay for it. The seller can also easily verify the payment through our web service. How we built itOur system consists of 2 parts: a mobile application and a web service. The mobile application is for customers. It registers the device with Klarna, scans QR codes and requests purchases via our web service. The web service contacts Klarna to perform requested purchases and provides interfaces and APIs for merchants to generate the magic QRCodes and manage payments.The mobile application was built with Android SDK and klarna-on-demand-android library. The web service was developed with Ruby on rails, materialize-css, and Klarna's payment APIs.Challenges we ran intoUnderstanding Klarna's architecture and SDKDeveloping Android app using GradleDeveloping our system using new tools in a short amount of time Accomplishments that we're proud ofAfter two days hacking, we're proud that our system can perform a complete work flow with stunning and elegant user interfaces.

 Oftentimes, communities that are impacted by natural disasters and economic disparity are unable to gain adequate resources from the government during their times of misfortune. In the United States of America, this has been demonstrated in varying instances such as the Flint Water Crisis and failed recovery relief attempts during Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Maria. These events acted as catalysts for the development of a necessary site to provide resources to disadvantaged and disaster-prone communities, and allows direct access to organizations willing to protect local needs.

 Your personal data is everywhere. Everyday, you make searches, browse websites, and enter information, all while leaving tidbits of your data scattered across the internet. Tech giants, like Amazon and Facebook, capitalize on this, by selling data you've left behind on their sites to data brokers, who use them for purposes such as targeted adds. Our goal is to completely disrupt this market. While we can't take this data away from these platforms, Liberdata strives to democratize personal data by letting people see what data they have out on the internet, and then sell it themselves. 
 These are the problems we're trying to solve:The old submission form was often long and tedious, so it was one of the negative aspects of the hackathon experience. (Do we really need ALL of these fields?)If you had already created a project in your portfolio on Devpost, you couldn't submit it to a hackathon. You had to copy over all of the fields from your project to the hackathon submission form if you wanted to submit it to a hackathon. This resulted in a lot of duplicate projects across the site (not to mention a terrible user experience).The project page is what lives on beyond the hackathon. Often times hackers don't craft this page very thoroughly (likely because they're pressed for time) but that leaves many projects pretty empty which doesn't create much value for people viewing the projects. Can we make it quick/easy to make a great looking project page?The old submission form – soooo long :(Goals:Integrate portfolio projects and hackathon submissionsMake the process of submitting much quicker and easier for hackersHelp projects look better / be more interesting to others

 As an US Army veteran, service to those in disaster-hit areas was always a core part of our mission. And during my service, I discovered that communications infrastructure holds the key solution to disaster relief.Three years ago my friends and I embarked on a volunteer drive from London to Ulan Bator and I purchased the people finding smartphone app Spot Connect device. After spending over $170 on the Bluetooth device and $99 on the annual plan, I was disappointed both with the UX, features, and what I knew could be utilized with just a simple iPhone and call plan. I knew this technology could be applicable to most areas in the world - since even in inner Mongolia I had great cell phone coverage.This iPhone app addresses the primary need of the emergency first responder - prevention of the continued loss of life.

 Alleviating the prevailing electricity crisis remains a challenge for Pakistan as persistent long hours of load shedding has adversely impacted economic growth of the country. ​There are still 112 million in Pakistan which either have no access to electricity or experience over 16 hours of load shedding. The shortage cannot be mitigated alone by adding power plants in the system as the​se​ come at considerable financial and environment cost. ​A smarter thing to do for all of us would be to make choices that are not only light on the pocket, but also on the socket. 
 Check out our Prezi hereWe used the Artik 10 Kit for this project.A lot of us have looked at various ways to save and conserve water. We, Team WPI decided to look at an option we believe is not fully utilized and is a source of water on a daily basis. The source, Air Conditioning. Each air conditioner has a runaway water pipe attached to it. This pipe essentially drains water formed by the condensation process inside the AC. Team WPI has come up with a way to harvest this water.We decided to focus on how each individual can contribute to this mission. This is because a 1.5 AC generates 0.3 gallons per hour while a 5 Ton Central AC generates 1 gallon per hour. Considering an average run time of 9 hours per day, a window AC generates 2.7 gallons each day while a Central AC generates 9 gallons a day!This trend has resulted in almost 87% homes with some sort of Air Conditioning equipment.  AC has virtually become a standard equipment of every household. Among 50 states in USA, California alone accounts for a massive 7.3% of air conditioning. A figure which is 5 times for than most states. This is because of the climate in California. California belongs to the region with hot/mixed dry climate type. With an average summer temperature of 90F and a year round temperature of around 80F, the high use of AC in California is justified.Let’s take a look at how this is a viable solution across the world. In 2013, a rough estimate of AC sales are approx. 900 million. A high volume of which are central ACs and rooftops AC. Together if we can implement E-Conditioner, we can save a lot of water and this in-turn will result more water available from traditional sources like dams and supply. 
 I have always loved the sci-fi genre and games. One other thing I enjoy is running and going for long walks out in nature. Recently, my wife and I both got Fitbit trackers to help encourage our walking and fitness routine. We found using them to compete for the 'highest' number of steps each day to be quite addictive and fun.When I stumbled upon this hackathon, I was researching Docker containers and Kubernetes for work related purposes. I thought to myself: why not combine the already addictive Fitbit experience of competing for steps and walking, with a fun sci-fi adventure game, and use an online service running on Openshift to enable Fitbit to talk to the game on player's devices?This would provide people with a mobile game that is not only fun to play, but also motivational in terms of exercise and fitness.In addition to that, I could make the game experience even more fun/competitive by adding online leaderboards to the platform running on top of Openshift.Thus, Stranded in the Expanse was born! 
  
 Have you ever missed a bus and have been caught up waiting with no things around except the bus stop? Isn't it boring to have the smartest technologies in the world and still having plain static ads shown on the bus stop billboards? Why the content creators are deprived of the tools and capabilities which mobile app developers have? We believe it is a time to open a new vision, the vision where ad creators become app developers having the opportunity to deliver engaging, IOT enabled and context based ads frictionlessly. We introduce visionOS. 
 A meal used to stand for more than just consumption of food. It was a symbol of friendship, companionship and love. We believe that this tradition should be preserved even in our fast-paced society today. "Table for 4" is created to bring 4 strangers together for a simple meal and hopefully through this meal, friendships and connections can be made.  
 Self-driving cars seem to be the focus of the cutting-edge industry. Although there have been many self-driving cars (such as Tesla), none of them have been ported to the cloud to allow for modularity and availability to everyone. Perhaps self-driving can be served just as how IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are served. This was also very much inspired by our long living hero, @elonmusk, who was, unfortunately, unable to attend this year's McHacks.  
  
  
  
  
 Montreal have plenty of potholes. We wanted to create a game that allows users to report potholes directly to the city. 
  
 When watching tutorials, lectures or any video on YouTube, I usually come across long videos, sometimes I don't need to watch the entire video but only specific parts of it. If I want to find when a word was mentioned in a video, I could use the seek bar to guess the position, but that becomes very hard especially on really long videos. What if there was a way to search the video and quickly find what you're looking for? That's where QuickSeek comes in. 
 Our mission is to empower local farmers and help them get their products the recognition they deserve. This tool allows them to advertise their foods on the web, and have them directly delivered to the consumers. That means more money goes into the pockets of local farmers, and customers are treated to fresh produce brought right to their door. Additionally, cutting out the need for supermarkets means far less gas is used in the transportation of these products, resulting in a far lighter carbon footprint. With our continued focus on creating a more and more efficient system, we hope to inspire more people to support local farms throughout the years to come.. 
  
 Last year I competed in the White House's Mental Health Hackathon. I learned that 40 million adults experience anxiety disorders and I wanted to figure out a way to help. 
 It can be difficult to pinpoint the strengths of a signal across different outdoor locations, so we decided to build a WiFi router locating system that would direct us to the closest and strongest router.  
 Tracking bots and other objects in a play field is complex and expensive, largely due to the wide array of sensors required on each bot, such as ultrasound and LIDAR sensors.Each bot also runs its own set of calculations for movement, possibly resulting in collisions and conflicts between individual bots.On the other hand, a central server with GOD VIEW can track the entire play field via a camera and several AR markers, as well as control the movement of each individual bot, reducing cost, complexity and possibility for conflict. 
 Kenton was sick and tired of being in the dark about trash pickup and recycling days. When he checked the City of Houston website, he had to go through 8 steps to get the schedule. There had to be a better way. Rollout!We wanted to make an app that had all the information you need (geolocated) the moment the app launched. Once you know the next pickups (the essential part), you can enjoy additional features that create added convenience.FeaturesInstantly see the next trash pickup date, next recycling pickup date,  next heavy trash date Schedule remindersFind recycling centers based on materialLearn about what's recyclableWhere we areSo in less than 24 hours, we have a pretty darned functional prototype.

 I come back from school every single day and go like, "ugh," when I realize I have to take a whole chapter of notes for Chemistry class each week from the textbook. I end up not wanting to do it so I procrastinate. This made me want to build an app that took notes for me. 
 We initially created a robot to deliver drinks in crowded bars and clubs. We could never get to the front of the line at crowded bars and we knew we could make them less crowded if a robot could travel in the sky to the tables.  So we set out to make it a reality.How we built itWe did the machining at TechShop SF and we did apps in angular.js (consumer) and ionic (bartender). The robot has a raspberry pi and everything on the server is running on docker on AWS.Challenges we ran intoNoise on the line on some of our circuits. Other hardware issues. From a developer experience perspective, the Alexa part was pretty easy (except maybe the documentation on account linking, but that wasn't that hard).Accomplishments that we're proud ofGetting it installed in a real bar in San Francisco. We are hoping to expand it to more bars and nightclubs soon.What's next for Alexa-powered Beer Robot.Installing in two more bars (one in Cincinnati, one in Oakland).

 How we could help the residential aware of environmental impacts  
 I was inspired by a French television programme called Des chiffres et des lettres which i used to watch with my father when i was young pen and paper in my hands. The programme tests the numeracy skills and vocabulary of two contestants.I wanted to develop such a game for long time using handwriting recognition but i though it would be quick tedious work until i found out about this challenge. 
 My brother who is in high school, was having trouble learning and referencing all the element information from his book. So, me and my mates decided to build an Alexa skill to help that. 
  
  
 It is 2016 and the greatest problem facing Americans is not ebola or starvation... it is the rapidly growing clown epidemic. Hundreds of terrifying (probably murderous) clowns have been spotted across the country but there is no way to keep track of them or stay safe, until now.  
 Polypharmacy is the study of the effects of consuming multiple medications and drugs. At this time, 45.1% of all Americans are taking one or more medications.  With each new medication, the possibility of negative interactions between the drugs increases.  Current clinical trials does not take into account all the medications a person can consume.  Medifact aims to remedy this by giving the power to the user to check if their combination of medications is statistically safe. 
 My inspiration for this app was as a medical student at UMKC I found that it would be helpful for patients have a way to know whether or not their wound was infected or not. WoundCare allows for that to be a possibility.  
 My mother was a former beauty queen, from another country, who had become completely forsaken to beauty. Though she was once even an Avon lady, she would not teach me anything about makeup. Once, when we were watching a late night beauty pageant, and I looked wistfully at the contestants, my mother told me, “No, you’ll never qualify.” I was not raised in a competitive family, but I had always personally believed in winning contests and at age 12, being told I had no chance meant this wasn’t worth the time investment at all. I learned early on, from my mother, the beauty expert, that I was not pretty.  18 years later, in the streets of NYC and Paris, on my own, I would discover the world of expert fashion stylists, who are able to make anyone look glamorous — they can even make an ugly girl look pretty. For anyone in this modern world, seeing yourself look amazing is transformative. It fosters hope and makes you believe in your dreams again. I want to help spread this magic.My goal in ShopFace is to build an AR product that lets anyone show off the look they want, and even share it so that others can, quite literally, instantly try it out. My aim is to create an innovative yet  universal platform to lets anyone express their beauty creativity by becoming a stylist, and by helping them discover and virtually try-on products they did not know could transform their looks. 
 I was watching a Twitch streamer playing Rimworld, their moderators were creating polls through the Strawpoll website, and the viewers were voting on these polls to trigger challenging events for the streamer. However the streamer was using the in-game developer tools to trigger these events and I thought at the time "You could automate this".That's where the idea came from, a way for viewers to directly influence the narrative of a survival game. Rimworld is a perfect fit, but I think we can do more. 
 There are approximately 200 million babies born per year.  However, around 1 million babies die from lack of attention.The mortality rate of accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ASSB) started to increase in the beginning of 1998 and had reached the highest rate at 20.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013.Approximately 52% of parents in predominantly Asian countries, had reported that their children has had a sleep problem.

 We first took aim at building a solution for the homeless population at the 2016 AT&T Hackathon in March of this year. In just 24 hours we built the physical appearance of a prototype that mimicked taking in and rendering data. We shelf the app as we all became busy with work until the HACC started. Deciding to take our 24hr prototype and use it for inspiration, we decided to build a full working mobile app and web application that took in and rendered data.  
  
 We were inspired by the opportunity to help shop owners get better results with their sales on the future.

 Do you know the frustration when a device in your office has broken and you would have to send an email about it to someone and you just don't have the time or don't know who to send the mail to. Or the frustration as a maintenance professional when you just get an email that a coffee machine in this huge building is broken, and you have to send 3 emails to figure out where it actually is.  ATS, Automated Ticketing System to the rescue.  
  
  
 Coming from both Enterprise Computing and Healthcare backgrounds, the team was surprised to find out that while Health Care Organizations (HCOs) pursue care-process improvement with Lean, analytics, and other approaches, they haven't adopted Business Process Management (BPM) - a field with many well-developed concepts and tools that have enabled measurements, analyses, and optimizations of processes in other industries.We wanted to determine the disconnects between the current BPM methodologies and tools, and care processes.  Then we wanted to devise a solution that would bring the proven process improvement methodologies to healthcare delivery.But it's easier said than done.  Currently, BPM (and its existing tools) makes a lot of sense when applied to a relatively fixed activities to produce relatively fixed business values (e.g. a widget).  But healthcare delivery is anything but fixed - patients and providers are unique, care pathways and care processes are not standardized within and across HCOs, and care outcomes are certainly not widgets.

 How many travelers seek destinations with similar weather to their favorite vacation spot? Are you a golfer looking to vary the annual trip to Myrtle Beach, but maintain the same temperature? Are you deciding on family vacation spots, and would love a list of destinations most similar in weather to Cape Cod?Embedded in our fondest memories is the weather of that particular day - a beautiful day at the beach, a perfect day on the slopes, or a sunny day on the greens. What if you could find that weather again somewhere, sometime, could you find that memory as well?In 1966 the famous surf filmmaker Bruce Brown traveled the world in search of an Endless Summer. Spending a year locked in their favorite weather sure turned out to be a great decision. In the spirit of The Endless Summer, I set out to find my own Endless Weather with any conditions I wished, and determine where that would take me- be it Utah, Vermont, or even Wine Country.High quality local climate data is kept in many locations nationwide, but is often just used to help pitch today's forecast or contribute to the global climate picture. What other stories can this data tell? Here, we find out.The IBM Bluemix cloud allowed us to take temperature and precipitation data and turn it into information rich maps and virtual itineraries telling us where and when to be. 
 The assignment for this Challenge was " Create a ‘wall worthy’ interactive map that illustrates one way in which you see the world.". We did it a bit different, we created a map of the world as we do not see it. There are thousands of cables, pipelines and tunnels, and of course even more natural resources, such as gas, oil, ore veins, and tectonical plates. Our goal was to make it work just fine.How it worksWe use the powerful openlayers v3 to render the data on our map, which is openstreetmap. On the back-end we created a way to load geojson from a clusterpoint nosql database, unfortunately due to the size of the files that had to be loaded, and the lack of time to improve the render engine we weren't able to use clusterpoint for all datasets, however the json generator is there.Challenges we ran intoOne of the biggest problems we ran into was performance, after 3 rewrites of the engine that handles rendering of data layers and different libraries we have found something that fitted our needs, yet it can get a bit slow sometimes.Meet the teamNick Vernij - Nick is a 16 year old developer and student from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, creating websites since he was 12.

 Team of 4 localsDon’t you hate it when you have barely 10 minutes between your classes and you think you have enough time to grab some coffee at Tims. However, when you get there the line is longer than your typical morning wait and it will be at least 20 minutes before you see any sign of a freshly ground coffee. Either you miss class or you miss your coffee.

 We have a few friends who are afflicted with ADHD and we have witnessed firsthand how debilitating and inconvenient the disorder can be. ADHD diagnosis is very complicated and time-consuming -- it can take up to 6-9 months and thousands of dollars. In addition, ADHD diagnosis is based on a variety of subjective factors and there is no definitive, quantifiable way to diagnose it. To add, treatment of the disorder can be a hassle as well, as it often involves usage of a suite of stimulants such as Adderall, all of which come equipped with side effects (such as appetite loss and depressive feelings). We wanted to create a VR solution to this problem that can provide both a diagnostic and treatment mechanism for ADHD.

 User stories in agile development are the foundation of a development team's work. Producing and working with user stories of appropriate quality is critical for development teams. There is a need for common understanding of the quality of their stories. 
 Everyone likes a good origin story, how did it all get started? The company TSOLife was incorporated in Sept 2014, but the concept was inspired decades before. It was inspired by loving grandparents, who helped raise a grandson from birth.My grandfather was a remarkable man, he had the opportunity to be an Olympic athlete, he was the recipient of the civic recognition award and he was inducted into his high schools hall of fame. His life is not only worth celebrating, it is worth remembering. The stories of his accomplishments could currently soon be lost. Verbal history dies after only 2 generations. There is no Wikipedia page dedicated to his life, no published biography documenting his many achievements; there is strictly what we remember.As it currently stands, history is only recorded for the famous or infamous, the rest are left to be forgotten. TSOLife was created with the conviction that we are all worth remembering–that life should be celebrated, passed down and remembered. We all deserve to leave behind a personalized legacy. History isn’t just for the famous or infamous but for all of us to leave something behind.While I have always felt strongly about this vision, it finally hit me when my grandmother passed in 2014 around thanksgiving. There is so much I never got to know about her, and even more I will forget. The only lasting legacy she left behind was her funeral service page. The notion that all that my grandkids will ever be able to learn about her is her name, date of birth, and occupation, haunts me.That notion ignited a fire: from that moment on I dedicated my life to creating a web platform that will truly allow our story to transcend time. I created TSOLife, and it will soon be launched nationwide in August. It is my greatest accomplishment thus far in life, and also my greatest regret because I didn’t make it soon enough for my grandparents. Their story is in my hands to tell, and I will do my best… though I know so much history has already been lost. 
 We liked the idea of the challenge, and to find out how fast we could develop and iterate on such a challenge. We decided to not only do one of the Kickers, but all three, as well as hosting the site on AWS and Google Cloud Platform, just for fun. 
  
 For students away at universities, it has become more important than ever to know how to take care of oneself. As college students, we are exposed to a variety of things, including alcohol. Even though we've all had educational classes or seminars in school about drinking safely, sometimes a gentle reminder can make a huge difference. That's where we came up with the idea of HappyHour, a pebble app that can keep you safe.  
 Our team has developed general-purpose L2 networking called GEO Protocol (GEO == Global Economics Overlay), that is blockchain-agnostic, is able to process payments/transfers in different accounting units (equivalents), has fast and predictable routing and is secured via quantum-resistant crypto.For the hackaton we have a very ambitious goal - to provide PoC of atomic cross-chain payments on top of L2 (when sender begins payment in one token/asset (eth, for example) and receiver accepts it in other one (btc, for example), and the network is responsible for paths discovering and atomic processing) During the EthBerlin we implemented first one connector for the GEO Node to the Ethereum ecosystem, and performed first multi-asset atomic payment between Eth. ecosystem and raw GEO network.  
 It's surprising see many different versions of a single language. The Americans, the English,the British, the Chinese, the Australians, etc have their accent. We all have faced difficulty in understanding the foreign versions of English which limits our capability to socialize and interact effectively with people of different cultures and backgrounds than us. We, especially being International students have faced this problem in our day-to-day life and it can get both embarrassing and frustrating.We want to bridge this gap by eliminating this barrier altogether so that we can understand others and express ourselves better. With "To-may-to To-mah-to" we hope to solve this problem make us more confident and comfortable.This applications' title was inspired by this classic song.

 Two years ago my 4 year old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and since then my main goal in life has been to manage her blood sugar (BG) levels within an acceptable range. Although there are quite a few technologies out there that are of great help in the management of Type 1 Diabetes, I believe there is a lot more we can do to make the lives of Type 1 Diabetics and their care givers easier. I work in data analytics in my day job and thought latest technologies like Internet-of-Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning/Deep Learning can be of great help in the management of Type 1 Diabetes. In the quest for better management of my daughter's BG numbers I decided to embark on this project to build a system that will capture all the information it can, in real-time, and analyze it and suggest treatment options in an easy to consume format i.e. text messages on phone. This system, in its fully developed form, could act like an AI brain which can suggest treatment plans in real-time to care givers/baby sitters.Type 1 Diabetes is an auto-immune disease in which the pancreas stops producing insulin which is an important hormone for converting food into energy. There are 1.5 Million Americans living with Type 1 diabetes and it costs more than $15 Billion each year to manage this disease. Diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease in America today. Improving the care for Type 1 diabetics is not only good for the patients themselves but also for the whole society in terms of lowering healthcare costs.Typically a Type 1 Diabetic's BG goes up when they eat food and their BG comes down when they inject insulin via an insulin pump or insulin shot. The BG could go too high if not enough insulin is taken and the BG could go dangerously low if too much insulin is taken. Currently healthcare providers suggest insulin dose based on a formula which takes into account the number of carbs in the food eaten. But a true calculation of the insulin dose should also take into account other factors such as the type of food and the activity level to name a few. Making sure the BG level stays within range is a daily battle and any assistance with this would be of great help. 
 Our team members are keen on computer vision and deep learning. Helvar’s challenge with intelligent light switch has inspired us to build a project at the junction of state of the art computer vision and people's everyday lives. 
 Our eyes are the mirror to the outside world and are arguably the most important of the five senses. More than 20 million people suffer from blindness due to a disease known as cataract. These people are deprived of their sense of perception due to -- (a) untimely detection, (b) lack of quick solutions, and (c) lack of basic awareness. Cataract is the root cause for 5% of the United States population, and 60% of the African and South American population suffering with blindness. Although, cataract has often been termed as a disease striking the elderly population, but it has affected unto 40% of the children in developing nations. We believe any step that can safeguard the human vision is a vital step. EyePhone is one such smart step that tries to predict the existence of cataract in the human eye.  EyePhone empowers its user with a simple application that helps to detect the presence of cataract in their eyes at a cost of a single picture of their eye ! 
  
 One of our team members is from India and is aware of the struggles that those of rural India face. Based on his observations, and some research we learned that a large portion of the global population does not have documented medical history. This means that when seeking medical treatment providers may be unaware of things like medical conditions, allergies to medicine, and previous medical history. Our goal is to create an inexpensive, scalable system to allow access to medical records for all. By carrying a card (for example a government issued ID) with all this information attached it would speed up hospital wait times, ensure proper care, and expand the total population with documented medical records.  
 Super Creature Showdown started as a hand-drawn game that I would put in my son Jack's lunch box each morning. Jack is 5-years-old and LOVES all things nature. Every day he'd look forward to getting a new Super Creature Showdown. Each morning I'd work to make them more and more elaborate, ultimately turning it into a math-based game with the goal of being fun and educational. This past Christmas we got an Echo Show and we thought it would be a great winter break project to build out a voice-based game. 
 Students everywhere always get stumped, and need help in order to overcome struggles with their studies. In many cases, they need the expertise of a tutor in the subject to aid them in the right direction.TutorMe provides quick and easy access to an expert in the subject, with a real tutor in the vicinity of the user. This way, they can meet in a timely manner and the student can understand as quickly as possible.How it worksThere are two ways to use the app: as a student or as a mentor.Each student just has to put in their name and and email, to be able to view all the available tutors.Each tutor will put in their name, email, subjects they know, as well as their rate. From there, the tutor's location will be pinged, and the student will be able to view all available tutors, the subjects they know, and how far they are.The student will then select the tutor he/she wishes to work with, and the tutor will be notified. This provides a seamless experience for both users to easily connect.How it was builtUsing Java, XML, a framework was established where calls could be made to the Google Maps API to grab location and display the map. Firebase provided the backend where it provides all the locations of the tutors, and the framework will interpret these locations, and drop pins with their locations as well as the details of the tutor.What we learnedTogether, we learned how to integrate Google Maps API as well as Firebase in Android, which none of us has ever done.Future UpdatesIn the future, filtering of subjects, profiles, and ratings will be implemented, thus increasing the usability of the appBuilt Withandroid-studiofirebasegoogle-mapsjavaxmlTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    nwHacks 2016    Created by  Designed UI/UX and logo.

 We wanted to create an app that everybody would like to play, and what is more enjoyable than Monopoly? So we took Monopoly as our inspiration. Also, we decided to use some of the most popular games of N64 as our properties because everybody loves old school video games!Rules-Objective: To be the most wealthy player in the game by buying, selling and renting their properties. -Participants: 2 to 6 players. -Money: Each player will receive a total amount of £1500-The bet: To be able to play the game, every player is going to be asked to set a bet of minimum £5 using a Pay Pal account. The player that wins the game, will receive the total amount of money in their Pay Pal account.If a player leaves earlier the game, he/she will not lose any of their money.-The game: The player that creates the game (the host) is going to be always the one that starts the play. The next player to play is going to be the first one that joins the game, the third player is going to be the second one that joins the game and so on. Everybody will start the game on the corner marked “GO”, then you will have to tap the button “Roll die” to know which is going to be your next position. You are allowed to buy “properties” or “sponsors” from your first go.-Go: Each time a player lands on or passes over “GO”, the bank will play him/her £20.Baying a property: Whenever you land on an unowned property or sponsor, you will have the   option  to buy it from the Bank in the price showed on the screen. -Paying rent: Whenever you land on a property/sponsor owned by another player, the owner will  collect rent from you in accordance with the price printed on the property’s card.-Jail: You land on “Jail” whenever you landed on the space marked “Go to Jail”. When you are sent to Jail, you are not able to collect your £20 salary that you usually receive from “Go”.You get out of Jail either by (1) staying there for 3 complete turns and being free in your 4th  turn or by (2) paying £50 to the bank.  If you land in Jail in the ordinary course of the game, you are “just visiting” so you incur no penalty and you are free to leave in your next turn.-Free parking & arrows in the board: When a player lands on this places, he/she doesn’t receive  any reward of any kind. Is just a free resting place.-Bankruptcy: A player is declared bankrupt if he/she owes more than he/she can pay.

 We want to impact the new generation by providing a tool to inform raise awareness on various issues of             society ! 
 1.4 million firearms were stolen in property crimes from 2005 to 2010.From 2005 to 2010, 3,800 people died from unintentional shootings; 1,300 of these victims were under the age 25.We want to give firearm-owners peace of mind by letting them know whether their firearm is secure at all times. 
 Some people make use of powerful successive approximations planning method that helps people reaching higher-level long-term goals. But to use it, you'd usually need some paper and pencil. We believe we can make it easier to use via modern technologies and popularize it. 
 Tech communities characterized by physical space, tooling and memberships such as Hackerspaces, Makerspaces, Fablabs have generally similar requirements for the software to manage their communities. With a pool of technically qualified and ambitious members with a "just-do-it" attitude this had led to the creation of tens if not hundreds of different management systems for these communities, with varying degrees of completeness. None of the current solutions on the market have yet have come to dominate and establish themselves as a defacto standard. This creates challenges for new communities when trying to select a system, often resulting in a perverse cycle of creating yet another management system that only sort of works for that particular community.At an high-level, these are the issues preventing widespread adoption of a single system:each system is often the result of a part-time or short-term volunteer effortsdifficult to reach a critical mass of users adoption necessary to sufficient generalize the systemchallenges in creating a critical mass of developers around the open source projectpoor understanding of global requirements (i18n/l10n, payment gateways integration, taxes, etc)hard for individual communities to evaluate the software quality attributes of a particular systemcomplexity in maintaining the software solutions and the data it generatesThis results in numerous problems, among which:time spent on management instead of makingredundant efforts invested in systemslack of support and long term maintenancelack of a defacto standard API to third party components (door locks)Frederic Bazin (founder of agora-space.com) and Ricky Ng-Adam (cofounder of xinchejian.com) with the help of Julien Choulet (a new active member and MeteorJS specialist) face these challenges regularly. Being software developers, we've decided to address these challenges by prototyping a new management system. We hope we can ensure continued development by using it as a teaching tool in addition to making it an exciting app for our members and other developers.Goals of the demoSome of the questions members can ask are:who are the members of the community?who are ACTIVE members of the community?who is in the space right now?In addition, authentication is required to gain privileged access to resources (such as Internet or the space itself) after authentication.We've decided to focus on:registering new membersassociating the device they use with memberstracking presence/absence of members in the spaceWho is there?A sequence diagram explains the flow we aimed to deliver during the hackathon:Accomplishments we're most proud ofBridging the gap between networking hardware and modern app developmentFinding creative ways to identify devices and displaying that in the interfaceChallenges we ran intoCreating a REST Endpoint the router can post IP -> MAC address mapping associated to public IPmaking sure ARP table is updated for all MAC addressescreating recurring cron job on deviceSubmitting and looking up [local IP, MAC address, public IP] on requestsCANDRA must also deal with the delay in the update of the IP -> MAC association (we know the local IP, but don't know the MAC associated yet)single organization can actually have multiple physical spaces with their own Internet routersN members * N devices * N IP addresses * N access pointsProblems connecting to external API to retrieve MAC specific information (unreliable service)Fetching and matching information between actually connected devices and ARP tableWhat we learnedMeteorJS is awesome out of the box:Fast development turn aroundEasier to teach new comersFast, responsive, reactive interfaces that update in real-timeEasier management of complex dependenciesWhat's next for CANDRAWe will continue working on the community management system in future hackathons organized at agora-space.com and as a teaching tool for codersfield.com in addition to continuing the development of it as an useful app that can be integrated to our communities.

 Confucius is the combination of Spotify music, Soundcloud, and breaking news in one package.The inspiration came from the fact that as university students, we don't have the time to constantly be looking for the best news sources. We also don’t have time to sit down and read the news diligently, especially when we are busy. Not only that, we found that with existing news applications, we were visually distracted while online, and were not able to just listen to the articles on these websites. We came up with an app that aggregates multiple news sources and translates their articles to audio, enabling users to take news with them on the go. 
 The critical event any IT service provider cares is a service outage(e.g. HTTP 5xx response). But there are just too many variables. uptime, Java gc counts/time, CPU, I/O util, swap memory usage, etc.Whenever you try to detect a service outage before it happens, you get screwed up by those countless variables.One day, I noticed Apache Cassandra uses a very simple metrics to detect a node failure, which is based on the following theory.http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~defago/files/pdf/IS_RR_2004_010.pdfThis inspired me to try HTM against simple PING response times to predict possible high load that could generate an error. 
  
 Many refugees come to Australia with high level skills in professions such as medicine and engineering. At the same time, many businesses and organisations in Australia are unable to find staff with appropriate skills to meet the needs of their operations. We want to bridge the gap between the two by setting refugees up with mentors from their communities so that they can become job-ready in Australia and so that they can use their skills to have a fulfilling career in fields where they already have expertise. 
 As students, we discovered that our mates are not actually studying what they wanted to study in the University. Not to mention, a lot of them don't have a clear vision of their career, they just wish to simply jump on whatever they see.

 I was inspired by the responses I received from broadcasters on Reddit, they wanted a way to easily create, edit and display schedules for their live streams, some broadcaster use an image in the panels section to link to google calendar, but a better way would be to display a dynamic schedule right in the panel section, this schedule would not only let broadcasters plan their events but also allow them to get feedback from viewers on specific events through polls and suggestions. 
 Elastic search has existed at Wayfair for a very long time. As part of the ELK stack (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana), it powers nearly all of the syslogging of our entire web service. Wayfair's heartbeat is effectively captured by these little bar graphs and line charts and are monitored 24/7 by our Frontline team to anticipate outages and react quickly and effectively. This technology is time tested and is worth its weight in gold. Its underlying architecture, Lucene, however, can do a whole lot more than just logging. Using its inverted index, it can power analytics, data modeling, and even generate recommendations! We decided to set out to prove this alternative use case for Elastic and are very pleased with the results 
 Many times while browsing the web, we are forced to see some images and content that we can't unsee. Such content is often disturbing and not appropriate to be viewed in public. It is even more harming when children are exposed to it. Battling this type of online harassment we decided to come up with a chrome plugin called Web Sanitizer. Most of the existing solutions maintain a white and blacklist of sites and block the whole site for the purpose. Many times it is not required as images come from ads and website's recommendation. We use machine learning algorithm provided by Clarifai to flag images with content that can be classified as adult and violent. This solution can be easily extrapolated to videos as well. So Happy Carefree Browsing!!

 Damian suggested looking deeper into Shamir's Secret Sharing, a secret sharing algorithm that could serve as an interesting encryption tool. Despite its potential use-cases, there have been limited real-life applications of the idea. Furthermore, such applications have been limited to only protecting strings. Hence, we decided to take this idea further and provide a SAAS - storing files securely using the same idea, and making it convenient to do so by abstracting away all the technicalities. 
 Our entire team is from Tembusu Residential College. We often experience inconvenience when using the washer and dryer machine as we are not sure whether the machines are used. This causes our residents to waste an immeasurable amount of time constantly checking if the machines are available for use or have completed their cycle. Thus, we thought, "Why not let the users tell others whether the machines are being used?" This will help save our time and energy as assessing the availability of the machines is just a click away!  We have witnessed Telegram Bots improving our quality of life, such as the SupperJio, CountMeIn bot and many more. Therefore, we are inspired to create this bot. :) 
 Child sponsorship programs usually do not provide sponsors efficient ways to build long-lasting, personal relationships with the child they are sponsoring. We wanted to build Telehope as a platform bridging the connection between sponsors and the children being sponsored. 
  
 I wanted to make a platformer at first but I didn't know how could I do it. So I started learning Unity. During the lessons that are about Unity basics I imagine my game. I want you to not only enjoy but also learn something too. Because there are many platformer are available on Google Play. So I made my difference with Maths and my game becomes runner. I wanted to reach everybody not only specific generation or region that's why I use Maths. I think with this game you can not only improve your practical math operations but also take great delight too :)  
 Justin Kahn was struck in the head with a baseball bat when he was 14 years old. In his teens and twenties, he would suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. When Justin was 27, he had a panic attack that scared him into seeking out the help of a neurologist. After working with her for almost a year, she discovered that he did not have PTSD. Instead, what he had been experiencing for 13 years, were seizures that were caused by the traumatic brain injury. She put him on an anti-seizure medication that alleviated what he had been experiencing.In 2009, he read an article that was in the speech that Robert Gates, the former Secretary of Defense, gave to the graduating class of West Point. He said that the Department of Defense was going to begin investing billions of dollars each year to address the PTSD epidemic plaguing all branches of the military. Justin grew up around the VA. His stepfather was an administrator for the VA. He thought that the way to address this problem would be to establish a relationship at the beginning of the service member’s career with their home state VA and have it continue into the rest of their lives. He knew from his own experience that the most effective mechanism for him to deal with his seizures, which can be similar to the symptoms of PTSD, was having someone to talk to. A lot has been done to address mental health in the military, but there are some service members that do not proactively address the issues they are dealing with. The reason is there can be a stigma attached with having mental health issues, as well as real world implications because they can be pulled away from their unit, possibly lose rank or pay, get passed over for advancement, or even be discharged. The result is, as troops transition to veteran status, some come back suffering from traumatic experiences that are having a dramatic effect on their transition back to civilian life. Justin approached the Salt Lake VA with the idea of having active duty troops being able to meet with VA practitioners from their home state while deployed, and have it be done through secure video conferencing. The VA agreed to test the concept of online care by teaching relaxation exercises to a small group veterans to see if they would have the same retention rate or better as doing in-person. When Justin received pre-seed capital in 2012 to start TruClinic, he approached his friend and software engineer, Trevor Wilkin. Justin Kahn/CEO and Trevor Wilkin/CTO have known each other since 2007, and have worked on multiple creative projects together. Brian Russon was originally introduced to TruClinic while he was with Microsoft and looking for Surface use cases in healthcare, of which we were utilizing with the University of Utah’s NICU unit. Brian joined the company initially in an advisory role for over three years before joining the company as Chief Revenue Officer. Lori Douglas joined the company as a result of her excellent work in the physician staffing industry with one of our investor/board members when we identified the need for someone to manage and grow our existing clients to ensure client success with our early adopters. Alex Zoller & Vitaly Leokumovich, co-Founders of Overl.ai joined the company in 2017 with the TruClinic acquisition of Overl.ai. Alex has over 10 years in the EHR industry and is now TruClinic's Head of Product. Vitaly is the co-Founder of IDEOM and Ego7 and is now TruClinic's VP of Engineering.  
 After reading Adam Mordecai's advice about writing 25 headlines for every piece of content you publish, I thought to myself — wouldn't it be great if there were a little microsite just for that - but with support for tweets & email subject lines too? So I built one. How it worksDepending on what type of content you're working on, the app will set character count triggers that color code your headlines. Yellow means you've passed the optimal length. Orange means you're headline is too long. And red means you've reached the maximum character limit. Your data is autosaved using localStorage, so you don't have to worry about losing any of your great prose and as of, you can share your headlines, (in read only mode). Click the "share & export" button and you'll be redirected to a permanent URL that you can share with friends & colleagues for feedback.Challenges I ran intoI could probably have written this without jQuery, but it would have taken me so. much. longer.  That said, I ran into a lot of issues figuring out how to access the inner text of my DOM elements. I think I used all of the following at some point: .text, .val(), .value, innerText, $(this), etc. As you can see on GitHub, this is some of the dirtiest code I've written in a while, but it does work.Edit, 12/9: Changed around sentence/title casing behavior so it's triggered onblur rather than onkeyup. Even with debouncing it was causing issues.Edit, 1/13: Moved email & twitter to their own subpages, created separate datastores for all three content types, massively cut down on JS, and eliminated sentence / title casing (was driving me NUTS). Edit, 1/22: Integrated spammy to flag subject lines that contain common spam triggers.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofI had an idea, and I implemented it — that's always huge for me. Also, I've gotten a lot of great feedback from fellow bloggers, copywriters, and marketers validating the idea / utility. What I learnedI had to create a sentence casing class, and using some code from SO, I learned how to extend the String prototype. All new stuff to me.What's next for 25HeadlinesI've got a few ideas below, but I'd love to hear from you. I'd like to add a progress meter  / gamification to provide some encouragement to writers — you don't want people to quit at #15.  Also, I've been thinking about a voting system (PH / HNstyle) so you can get feedback form your colleagues before you pick something. Also, maybe a way to connect this to Hootsuite or Optimizely.

 Business users already collaborate with their colleagues on Cisco Spark. Forcebot for Cisco Spark was built to eliminate the app-hopping so users can quickly bring up information right from the chat console itself. This also avoids the multiple clicks needed in Salesforce, which is a big productivity drain. Forcebot also allows you to customize your notifications in the specific Space so people don't get swamped with unrelated notifications. Further, sales people should have the ability to get a quick snapshot of their sales progress from Cisco Spark. We've built Forcebot to enable sales people to work better, including the ability to chart all Opportunities closing in a bar chart, get notifications on tasks due today, claim leads right in Cisco Spark and more. 
 At one of our previous Devpost internal hackathons, Brian created the ultimate office hack. Our kitchen was too small to fit our growing team during lunch time. Sandwich making was chaos. So Brian built a sandwich cart:And today, on yet another internal hackathon, we decided to appropriately commemorate his contribution:

 Many kinds of everyday automation exist in the world of today. Home control systems allow you to control lights in your house over the internet, coffee makers start before you wake up, and you can release a small robot to vacuum your floor.While not everyone may have the need for a robotic vacuum, or want to control their house over the internet, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to find someone in the developed world who will be left unaffected by self driving vehicles. You won’t even have to own one to have your life revolutionized by them. Public transportation will become driverless, traffic flows will become seamless, and people will even release their cars out into their local area to work as taxis for them!These vehicles will need to use collision avoidance systems, still being perfected today, to stay out of the way of obstacles such as people, signs, the side of the road, and other vehicles. This kind of system is adequate in today’s world, full of traffic lights and conscious drivers, but another technology will need to be proven before humans get off the road. This technology is vehicle to vehicle communication. Without this, driverless cars will be restricted to relying on local sensors, and the traffic jams of today will only become worse. Using vehicle to vehicle communication, not only can cars practice actions such as synchronized acceleration and deceleration, alleviating these jams, but can talk to each other ahead of an intersection to avoid a collision. The latter was the focus of this project.My project used an Arduino 101, along with some electronic sensors, to convert an old remote-control car into an intelligent, driverless vehicle that can communicate with other vehicles in order to avoid an imminent collision, along with being able to avoid simple obstacles. 
 "If you love life, don't waste time, for time is what life is made up of" - Bruce Lee"Ngaret".. a word that heard really familiar in our ears and it is like becoming Culture in Indonesia in negative ways. Most people “ngaret” when doing their daily activity or often this activity give bad impact on other people around them including to us. Such thing inspires us to solve the bad culture by developing an android-based application.During the development process, we investigate and discuss with those people who likes “ngaret” and found that there are two factors caused which is Internal and External factors. We define the Internal factor caused such as habit (or we call it previously as culture), laziness, and forget, while the external factors are traffic, accident, or natural disasters.Referring to the above factors, we assume that the main reason of the “ngaret” is “HABIT” and the only solution is moving on and realizing the negative effects if we do our activity “ngaret” instead of being punctual. In conclusion, Faster “Ngaret” habit you remove, Faster advantages you will get. Be Punctual not Ngaret! 
 Simply put, mobile data is expensive. With companies such as Rogers charging upwards of $10 for a mere 100 mb, using data is often extremely cost-ineffective.

 We build smart clothes with an ability of motion tracking. The main 2 things are:1) You don't need any cameras, hence our product can be used in anywhere unlike Kinect, for example.     It can be used either for AR gaming in the street and for sports education. Imagine you are a coach and you are training someone wearing our smart clothes. With our clothes you can view 3d model of the sportsman in real-time and this brings analysis of sportsmen's motions to another level. Also it is possible to add some extensions for such a clothes to make our system report sportsmen about their mistakes automaticaly!2) Our smart clothes are extremely cheap compared to other solutions - it's total cost doesn't exceed 20$ !!!

 My grandmother has Diabetes and I have a big family I was thinking that if people in my family can understand how to better prevent Diabetes through better nutrition habits the idea could prove useful. 
  
  
 My inspiration was my Grandmother who died when I was young due to Alzheimer''s. I was pretty young but I really wanted to do something to help her anyway I could. Eventually I did become a programmer and started exploring new technologies to ideate and innovate. I found the Alexa Skills Challenge on Devpost and put my registration in. So, I created this AI based Doctor that gives a user his/her diagnosis based on the symptoms. I knew that there are no existing apps in the market for public use that even remotely gives the user a steady description. I did my research. This allowed my to think freely and move in towards building my code. Hence, I built Medical Assistant. I kept the name simple as it is what it's name sounds to be. 
  
 With all the challenges that humankind needs to take, the biggest hope rely on young people and the next generations. Education is the most powerful way to bring awareness about those challenges, and gaming and entertainment are some of the main ways to communicate this awareness. 
 After creating my first APL skill I was really intrigued with what else I could do that would really create an enjoyable & fun user experience on a multimodal device, and which would would be just as awesome on a speak only (headless) device #voicefirst.

An Alexa skill that lets you choose from a variety of audio loops to create your own audio track. 
 There was recently an article on TechCrunch about how APIs are the new FTEs. Thinking about how usually startups have limited resources we thought we want to help start ups and companies that do not have the capacity to hire back-end developers to create REST APIs that support their front-end applications. We tried to come up with an approach that is flexible and easy to use. 
  
 You hear “Where is/are” anywhere. We have a lot of applications like Google map. However, you sometimes cannot find what you are looking for because these applications are most often show in 2D mainly. Furthemore, it is annoying to use only 2D information because you have to look for an application and real world back and forth. So, we resolve this problem by using this new AR Navigation System which guides you to where you are looking for by following arrows which show in both of 2D and 3D.  
  
 I was inspired to create ConnectOnCommute after experiencing my own new tribe moment moving out to Boston. I found it very challenging to break out and meet new people, make new friends, and really feel like I 'belonged' in my community here. After a few weeks of feeling increasingly disconnected from my environment, I decided to put on a namebadge that said "Ask me about tacos". Within the 4 hours I had been wearing the badge, 14 different people would jokingly walk up and.. well.. ask me about tacos. Before I knew it I was having a random conversation with almost each one of them. After talking to some other people about my feelings at the beginning of my journey here, I found that I wasn't alone in feeling alone. It turns out 48% of Americans feel lonely most or all of the time, and 52% feel that no-one knows them well. Our brains have evolved to need social acceptance in much of the same way that we need food and oxygen- and it's because of this that many studies agree chronic loneliness can be more detrimental to our health than obesity and equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.When I got to #HackHarvard2019, I had spent a lot of time thinking about that experience and wanted to see how my team could use tech to help foster a world of more deep, meaningful connections. Social media does a great job maintaining friendships once they start, but there's somewhat of a gap in initializing that first conversation; ConnectOnCommute was designed specifically do promote serendipitous interactions with the people to the left and right of us, all across our community.  
 My Alternative Spring Break trip from the Pennoni Honors College last year focused on homelessness. I spent a week living at a homeless shelter in Old City and each day would volunteer at a different food bank and shelter. I spent a lot of time sitting down with individuals who had no permanent residence and asked them if there was anything I could do to help. A lot of individuals mentioned that the only access they had to internet was via the public library or free internet kiosks; however, almost everyone had a private non-smartphone. 
  
 In the development of Adroit, we were inspired by the design process itself - as we yearned to arrive at a chosen problem which would address healthcare, social good, fintech, education, or better yet a combination of the four. While brainstorming ideas for such problem statements, we agreed there was potential for using natural language processing to analyze frustrations and complaints, using human-centered design principles to light the way. We began designing a way to provide hackathoners and businesses with problem statements so they can focus on what they do best - solving them.Out of this idea came Adroit, an easy-to-use reputation and sentiment analysis tool. We sought a project that would challenge us with skills and frameworks which are new to us, while also keeping human-centered design in focus. Adroit is both a business/fintech tool - intended to help companies identify their weaknesses - as well as generalizable software which allows users to discover problems in any domain. Enter a search term and see what complaints people have about it, and get a summary of the most frequent commentary!  JetBlue use case: As one use case, Adroit was designed to meet @jetBlue's design requirements. We hypothesized that aggregating complaints from social media and analyzing their similarities could point to services that may need attention, indicating recent major customer concerns with the company. Although Adroit's knowledge is currently drawn specifically from Twitter and we do recommend further development using other data sources, a test run on recent data indicates, for instance, "wheelchair" and "mobility" as major concerns, identifying accessibility as potential business priorities.

 Ambient Orbs, Chumby, PS3 Dashboard, and the 1st Gen Xbox Interface are inspirations for Colossus. Colossus builds upon the idea of a dashboard with an enhanced IoT twist--you can track information that's important to you (i.e. biorhythms, calorie counter, medication reminder, stock tracker, etc...) and have it display or have a server calculate an answer for you and display the answer on an Colossus' LCD or have Colossus interact with you once it detects that are close-by via a proximity sensor.

 Back in 2007, I was a young design engineer at Caterpillar, working on CAD models of engine parts. It was neat and all, but I hated having to use my mouse + some fancy keyboard work to spin / move / scale models. It was both  hands on the table all the time. I dreamed of something more Minority Report—an interface where I could just flick the air in front of me and the model would move. Something like this: Careful, Chief. Dig up the past, all you get is dirty.While things have gotten a lot better (touch screens), I'd still like a lean-back interface where I could contemplate the world while effortlessly spinning my models.And with CAD Viewer, I think I'm halfway (ok, 10%) there. 
  
 Our inspiration to create "Issue Dependencies Viewer" was our customers and our own experience with complex projects, where issues dependencies get so complicated, that Project managers have real hard time finding out why certain issues get delayed over time due to other issues. Having an easy way to view issues dependencies is vital for the management to take timely actions, re-distribute the resources and ultimately avoid missing the deadline.

 Nagging your kids to go to bed can really ruin the relaxed atmosphere needed to fall asleep. I wanted to create an experience where Alexa can help kids complete their bedtime routine, transition into a peaceful evening mode, and inspire them to come up with happy thoughts before bedtime to increase the chance of falling asleep in a good mood and have good dreams and a good night's sleep.

 Visiting an office you have been to multiple times and still having to check-in using archaic and inefficient technology is a drag. Pens and paper? No thanks! Filling out the same digital form again? Even worse! It's slow and costly and organizations spend countless hours managing written data. It is time for something better.  
 The idea came as a way to bring conversation and work closer. We spend most of our time talking on HipChat and less time on Jira. A to-do list in a room, that is always visible, is a great way to create focus in a conversation. The to-do list ensures everyone knows the important things to look after and keeps everyone in the loop about what is being done.  
 There was a moment where I wanted to take a really quick note without having to go through the hassle of creating a note in Notes. I had my browser open but there weren't any light-weight note taking applications that allowed you to use HTML and Markdown that I knew of. So I came up with the concept of Notus. 
 I recently had to use a captcha and was frustrated by how many tries it took me to prove that I wasn't a robot. Then it hit me, why are we looking at squigly text, what's more human than emotions? I had just looked through indico.io's list of apis and saw that they had a facial emotion detection api and it looked pretty doable to implement, so I thought why not create a proof of concept for the first emotional captcha.How it worksEmotcha shows a user an image of a human's face and the emotional profile of the face. Next to that is a live webcam view of the user and a stream of their emotional profile. Once the profiles match, the user is able to login to the mock website.Challenges I ran intoThe indico api expects just faces, so I had to implement live facial localization into the algorithm. Doing this while also fighting to keep the webcam view as smooth as possible was quite challengingAccomplishments that I'm proud ofI'm proud of the general user experience of the proof of concept, that it just works. What I learnedI learned how to implement a variety of powerful tools, indico.io's apis, materialize's beautiful css framework, and facial detectionWhat's next for EmotchaNext is to make it responsive (cause it really isn't, curse of being a backend guy) and perhaps package it up on npm so that other developers could actually use it in the futureBuilt Withcsshandlebars.jsindico.iojavascriptmaterializeTry it outgithub.comemotcha.herokuapp.com      Submitted to    Reinvent the Selfie | Summer JamWinner                Twilio Grand Prize - Take Your Selfies to the Next Level              Winner                All you can EaaS                  Created by  Austin Greene 
 When working with StepNC data our team realized that our project could be adapted to use real machining data. MTConnect allows our simultation to be used in much more powerful ways. We envision our project being used in various commercial applications to provide real time monitoring of several machines from one location. Through the use of this software, the efficiency of the manufacturing industry could also be improved by up to or exceeding 15%. The MTConnect data correlates well with STEP-NC data which is our team's main inspiration.

 Every day we are exposed to harmful levels of noise and don't even realize it. Studies show the adverse impact of sustained or prolonged loud noise on our health is not just limited to hearing impairment, but can include increased risk of hypertension, heart disease and stress. Annoyance, sleep disturbance and decreased school performance are also sufficiently attributed to noise exposure (ref: Passchier-Vermeer W, Passchier WF (2000). "Noise exposure and public health". Environ. Health Perspect. 108 (Suppl 1): 123–31. doi:10.2307/3454637). Additionally, in occupational settings there are tools that have been developed delineating high-risk noise exposure zones based on point source measurement, but there is a need for a cost effective personal noise exposure capture device used for data collection and visualization in real-time. Deployment of ten or a dozen NEATVIBEwear devices in a single factory/plant production area is more cost effective than procurement of one industrial noise monitoring handheld device. To reliably assess exposure to occupational risk factors it is vital to have estimates of where workers spend their time and how they spend it. The study of Time Activity Patterns (TAP) attempts to answers these questions.  Most time-activity studies for health data collection are written in diaries or entered in on-line surveys, which are inherently biased due to differing degrees of recall and accuracy in reporting (ref: Time Activity Patterns in Exposure Assessment, EUR 15892 Report, EC Directorate on Science., R&D, 1995). Some TAP studies now can be mobile device enabled, but few (if any) record real-time noise exposure coupled with time-activity data. Fitness trackers have similar functionality, but do not include noise exposure.  Collection of accurate, cost-effective real-time TAP and noise exposure would enable factory or plant workers to better protect themselves from risk of hearing loss and other noise-associated harms as studies show work-induced hearing loss is a result of repetitive high noise exposure and workers who are overexposed to noise are at risk for developing hypertension (ref: Assessing High Noise Areas, G.Battista, OH&S, May 2016).The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) within the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has established exposure limits for various decibel (dB) ranges, and yet most people aren't aware of their exposure to noise nor exposure at various noise levels.Although there are smart phone apps that can measure dB levels, these apps are limited as they can produce false and/or interrupted readings resulting from phone calls, texts and/or when the app is closed. Additionally, the Smartphone sampling rates may be constrained and battery life can be a concern as well. Finally, if the Smartphone is off it can't capture noise level information.Hence, a Noise Exposure, Activity-Time and Vibration Wearable (NEATVIBEwear) device!! What NEATVIBEwear doesNEATVIBEwear is a personal noise capture device integrated to a Smartphone (for the purpose of displaying information) giving users the ability to:View real-time noise exposure at a glanceMonitor and track cumulative noise exposure either on the NIOSH scale or broader "Health Risk" scaleSave summary exposure information to log noise cumulative exposure over timeReview and understand available information regarding noise exposureHow we built itNEATVIBEwear is an integration between a personal noise capture device built using an Arduino 101 with the Grove Loudness Sensor (with the potentiometer for adjusting gain and a wide frequency range) and Android Smartphone running the gaming platform Unity as it provides the ability to render a representation of the real-time sound in a 3D color coded simulation. The Arduino 101 and the Smartphone are integrated through the Arduino 101's on-board Curie Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capability.We use the standard formula (20*log10(V/Vo) to convert the electrical signal from the loudness sensor to dBs and then use additional mapping and smoothing calculations to calibrate the dB readings to external digital sound level meter (SLM) readings. This approach is ideal and practical for showing both NIOSH and "Health Risk" scales of noise levels of exposure.Challenges we ran intoWorking with new technology always presents challenges and we can't think of anything that wasn’t associated to some challenge. Below are the major challenges we encountered:Understanding the BLE architecture and how to use it from publish-subscribe APIs to UUIDs for the services and characteristics.Learning how to manage the BLE states and hex data conversion within the Unity C# scripts.Figuring out how to convert the loudness sensor electrical signal output to accurate dB readings across a range of noise frequencies to display on the mobile app including use of signal to dB conversion, equations for mapping and smoothing and a SLM for refined calibration.Realizing our expected use for the Grove Vibration Sensor was not in align with the intended use for the sensor resulting in a re-directing of our focus toward the more important noise monitoring and tracking and removal of the scope associated with the vibration and motion sensing. We learned that our original expectation for the vibration sensor based on web findings, for instance, to detect and quantify the low frequency rumble of a motor or vibration imparted to the NEATVIBEwear device was just not correct.Accomplishments that we're proud ofHaving developed a product to help people understand their own personal noise exposure and more importantly their cumulative exposure at various noise levels which is an important step to reduce their noise exposure and associated risks to their health.  Creating a product with a framework for capturing noise data for further research and studies.Deciding to use the Smartphone as only a display device reducing the risks of bad data and/or insufficiently granular data. Selecting Unity as the rendering and display environment as it opens up opportunities to integrate real-time sensor data easily with a multitude of delivery platforms including: mobile, PC, browser and as well Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR). Successfully integrating components together that we had never used or integrated together before in a very short time period.What we learnedTaking on challenges with only little to no experience can be exceptionally rewarding, exciting and fun! One never knows what one can learn!Using emerging technologies have the potential to define opportunities in the future with just a bit of creativity. Working with the Arduino 101 and the Grove Starter Kit Plus on the hack opened up our eyes to how exciting these products are as we have only used a couple of the sensors. We are now Arduino 101 and Grove sensor evangelists! Stopping work on this idea is not an option as we now see the important value NEATVIBEwear can have reducing health risks to individuals and society in addition to providing better consistency and quality data to research and studies, for example, crowd sourcing data from multiple NEATVIBEwear users within a noise-impacted area.What's next for NEATVIBEwearWe are currently planning to:Enhance the functionality and capability to support not only a better user interface, but additionally to educate users that they are not just helping themselves reduce health risks, but they are "Citizen Scientists" providing important information for research and studies to reduce health risks throughout society. Improve the quality and accuracy of the data calculations to increase the value of the information captured for research and studies. We used a fairly simplistic approach to meet the hack objective to show the exposure for both NIOSH and "Health Risk" noise level scales. More precise calculations would be necessary to support research and study needs. Work with companies and institutions (e.g. - manufacturing plants, hospitals, construction companies, etc.) who expose their employees to high noise levels and redesign this product to help employers understand those exposure levels as well as reduce the health risks associated to noise exposure to better protect the health of their employees. Add capability to save detailed data on the Arduino coupled with the functionality to send that detailed data to the cloud to better support research and studies in addition to IOT opportunities and initiatives.

 As college students, we found that we spent a lot of our time in lines--whether it was the line at the dining hall entrance, in front of the squat rack, or into the big basketball game.  While getting lost in some of these crowds is inevitable, a lot of frustration and waiting could have been avoided if we simply knew how congested these places were before we left our dorm rooms.  If we had a way to monitor everyone on campus, we could figure out when to head to the gym, find the ideal quiet studying spot, and determine when to line up at our favorite campus eatery.Of course monitoring everyone is not feasible--but perhaps we could get close.  We decided that all we needed to do was monitor all of the doors going in and out of each of these places of interest.  This would allow us to compute the population of our favorite places in real time -- and with this, help us plan our days better.  Ideally, we would like to have something to the effect of placing a turnstile near each of these doors.  However, conventional turnstiles are big and bulky, and no one likes having to walk through them everywhere they go.  Was there a way to do this in a less intrusive manner?We had previous experience using ultrasonic sensors and accelerometers in a biomedical devices laboratory in college, and we decided to combine these sensors into a more advanced occupancy sensor device. The Arduino 101 was simply the best device to develop on. The internal inertial motion unit, Bluetooth low-energy communications, I2C bus connectivity, Arduino community, and sensor module libraries all came together to produce a cohesive device for us. 
 Small scale braille printers cost between $1800 and $5000.  We think that this is too much money to spend for simple communication and it has acted as a barrier for many blind people for a long time.  We plan to change this by offering a quick, affordable, precise solution to this problem.

 1200.aero was created by a small team of pilots and aviation enthusiasts. Inspiration came from a near-mid-air collision one of the authors experienced in the fall of 2015 as he departed his favorite airport. In the information age, there is still no data about the airspace surrounding small airports, and that's what we're set out to improve. 
 As a student, nothing brings more cheers than the knowledge of free food. After burning all those calories running computers, losing track of time, and when your turn to food, there is hardly any food left. You start to worry, where you can find food on the campus. Well for UMBC students, you don’t have to worry anymore, download our app, “Feed Me” and you have the listings of all the food you can find on the campus. Expensive, cheap or free, no matter what we have listed it on our app and where you can get.

 -The inspiration for the project was inspired by a few ideas and goals of each team member based on work  and research experience as well as first-hand experience. The idea to create a central hub that not only aggregates multiple routing data sources that are not normally linked together (such as driving a to a bike location and then cycling), but creates routes optimized for individuals users based on their personal preferences is a novel and exciting endeavor. Furthermore, route selection is usually done without users being fully knowledgeable of the consequences or how other routes may offer other scenarios that may be potentially beneficial to the user.  
 As an Office 365 customer, we have got several productivity and collaboration tools like Groups, Teams, Planner etc to drive our business. Microsoft has designed these tools keeping in mind to help SMB business owners to take care of their business themselves. Even though Microsoft provides such a wonderful toolset, as a business owner, we find difficult to deal with day-to-day support / sales tickets and define internal process as the tasks related to it span across different Office 365 Groups.We understand that Planner is built with the mindset of people collaborating within a Group/Plan. When we need to create/assign a task for another Group/Plan which we are not a member of, Email is the only way.As a SharePoint user, we know how to use SharePoint in most of the scenario we talk about, but it is painful for a Business owner to customize SharePoint to match his business needs as IT is governed by business owners in a majority of SMBs.So we realized the value of connecting the dots in Office 365 and make Office 365 even more productive. This is how the idea of Office 365 Cards evolved. Office 365 Cards empowers you to gather, organize, collaborate and view all related information as List & Cards. 
 Working in teams is todays new normal. Microsoft provides us with great service, Microsoft Teams. One of our goals in iGlobe is the dream of one workspace. Having all the information and programs you need at anytime and anyplace. Important however, is to have it all just one click away. Microsoft Teams gives us exactly that. You can have, Chat, calls, meetings, create a Planner, insert a SharePoint Site, and many other services.  We want iGlobe CRM Office 365 users to have access from teams to selected customers. Making it possible to get customer information directly from within the team not having to go from one service to another.  Breaking down silos and realising the dream of one workplace.

 One of our colleagues grew up on a farm in Iowa.  We wanted to see if we could mash up the USDA datasets to help existing farmers become more productive. As we undertook this challenge, we kept a few design principles in mind: keep the data local and relevant to farmers, and layer interesting data on maps to draw insightful conclusions. 
 I created this project to help people and I found my problem myself because I encountered with it. I wake up very early to go to school. At that time my family is sleeping and I don't want them to wake up. Our windows and curtains are closed at that time that's why I can't see the weather condition. I had a problem with rain and temperature last school year. In the end I want to make a Weather Station to see and get real time data and be ready for it.

 After talking to more than 80+ Instagram brands and influencers, we identified they have a serious problem when it comes to audience engagement. Sometimes their audience doesn't feel motivated to engage with their content and that could lead to lower brand visibility due to Instagram feed algorithm. The Kin tokens are game-changer that has potential to put community engagement on steroids. But Instagram brands, influencers and celebrities (ex: local salon, restaurant, fashion models, travellers etc...) are not tech-savvy to empower their community with Kin and these are the people who always crave to increase engagement ratio within their audience community for organic growth.

 Simply put, our project bridge the gap between science fiction and reality. We are a group of anime fans who dreamed of anime characters coming to real life since our childhood. In the past 3 days, we made our dreams come true. Our AR battle simulator projects hologram on our favourite anime characters to bring them to life. We achieved two main goals: projecting hologram to bring our anime protagonist to live; casting Japanese ninjutsu in hologram form through ML Hand Sign Recognition. These used to be only items that exists in anime classics such as Naruto (an anime about Japanese Ninjas) , Yugioh (an anime about a card game that can summon virtual/real monsters), but today we brought them from the 2D display to the 3D world.  A small step for 4 anime fans, a giant leap for the anime community. In addition, the anime industry is a huge untapped market in the west. According to Hollywoodreport, the revenue of the anime industry in 2017 was 19.1 billion USD. The industry is full of figure collectors that are more than willing to pay for innovative anime merchandise. Not only is our project a major breakthrough for the anime community, it is also potentially extremely profitable.

 While sorting and scanning our grandmother’s collection of personal papers, we were overwhelmed in a sea of letters, diaries, photos, and other personal documents. As we pored over the handwritten pages, we realized we needed a solution beyond just digitizing.Already avid indexers and family historians, we envisioned a tool that enables individuals, families, and organizations to index and tag their own histories—letters, journals, and other personal records—resulting in an accessible, searchable, archive. With the power indexing has to bridge generations, cross religious and cultural boundaries, and unite people, we became determined to bring family collections of written documents out of obscurity through indexing. These documents—replete with names, places, and stories—will enrich a family’s history, connect records to researchers, and fuel the find for historians everywhere. 
 Too often, we wake up to an inbox flooded with promotional emails. You can go through each of them to make sure you see everything, or you can skip over them to save time and wind up missing out on something you really want.  Nobody likes the feeling of finding out their favorite band is performing nearby once tickets have sold out or hearing about a great sale at a store they love after it’s ended; but keeping up with so many emails can get very time-consuming. With Steez, you don’t have to settle for either alternative.Steez checks your incoming promotional emails for you and finds the announcements, events, and deals that match your personal taste, so you can break free from your inundated inbox with the comfort of knowing you won’t miss a thing. How it worksWe get to know your steez by connecting to Foursquare and Spotify’s API’s to import your favorite places to go and your favorite music to listen to. We also track your online purchase activity using Context.IO’s email API to better understand where you like to shop and dine through order confirmation emails from stores and services like OpenTable. Equipped with all of this knowledge about your preferences, we’re able to provide you with a personalized experience that’s far simpler and faster than any encounter you’ve had with your email inbox. Just sign up with your email address to connect to Context.IO’s API and we’ll start searching your incoming emails for announcements, events and deals that feature your steez and notify you of them when you log in. You can easily adjust your preferences on your profile and we’ll pick up on any changes you make within Foursquare or Spotify so we can continue to cater to your steez.Challenges I ran intoThe main challenge I faced was developing this app on my own in a language I had never used before. It was also very challenging to extract the relevant details from deals and events referenced in emails, given the wide array of HTML structures out there.

 Microsoft Office 365The concept of “going to work”, arriving at a specific location and working on a specific task either as an individual or with the same group of people has changed. The “office” workplace is becoming a collaboration hub where employees meet “face-to-face” anytime anywhere and spend time connecting with each other. Work is increasingly occurring in teams, in shared space, both in or outside the "office".For that we need to Re-Design of the Workplace, transformation in work with a need to adapt to where and how employees work. Transforming employees changing the workplace itself is relatively easy. Changing the behaviors and mind-set needed to work effectively and realize the benefits of workplace changes is challenging. Office 365 is a unique platform for both small, mid and large enterprises. We want to make Plug & Play extension for small companies.

 So I became Alexa Developer a few months back. I'm a Third Year CSE student and always loved to explore and experiment with the technology around me. Voice is the next big thing in the industry with over Millions of AI enabled voice assistant devices already in the market. This is my first skill using APL and I hope it results out good. Didn't have much time to develop as my academic work was also there, but still I'm happy with my end results. Inspiration for this skill came to me from daily foodie desires. I always ask my mom to cook me something new everyday, but we can't decide what to make half of the time. 
 The efforts students put on their books is low. We came up with the idea of helping students getting assess to their books and also test their level of comittment to their books. We set up a test will be given after each book has been read. Also the student adds a teacher to follow up with the study plan. The teacher gets a notification on the student time table and work with him. Brought up another idea of setting up a study group where students communicates with each other on a particular course. Teachers can be added to it. WHY DO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONwe are solving this problem by creating a web application which will help the student create timetables that will help them at their courses with the assistance of the teacher who will receive a notification based on the time table created by the student.

 You ever just go to a hackathon, plan to do something VR related never having done anything VR related before, can't figure out why you're computer won't detect the obviously plugged in VR rig, stay up through the night troubleshooting the problem for probably 6 hours, realizing that you're HDMI port connects to your integrated graphics card and not you're GTX 960M you thought it would, and decided to calmly, but depressingly, pack up the rig and return it? Yeah? Me neither. 
 Ever had your ideal holiday crushed by the need to gesture and mime awkwardly in 90% of your conversations? Have you ever wanted to pick up short phrases in another language that you would probably use in everyday conversation? How about fiddling around with your phone aimlessly while waiting for someone or something? Inspired by the relevance of picking up a few phrases and the desire to spend time productively, we came up with this app so that you can learn something even in the few minutes it takes for your morning cuppa to be ready.  
 On frontend side, we used Google's Material Design and Angular.js because is a lot of fun!!On backend, we chose Java and Jersey because we are experienced on these. 
  
 With the advent of chat applications, the beginning of a new era was marked which will have people all connected through such applications.Such applications reduced the communication gap considerably between the masses. Hence, the seeding of our idea to build Medbot. People love the idea to communicate using chat applications and thus MedBot can help bridge the gap between common people and their knowledge about their own medical conditions. Fun part is that anyone can do this using a chat user interface. People will have an interactive chat with Medbot which will be targeted towards medical conditions of a person. 
  
 A large amount of customer communication takes place via email. That is why we created an Office 365 Outlook Add-in to give you the best integration to iGlobe CRM Office 365 no matter what device is used.  
 Amazon Alexa being a voice first interaction device/platform, and a session based (speak/listen/reply) kind of usage pattern, there are limited things you can do with it when it comes to kids. It boils down to a "ask question, expect answer" kind of a platform. As a developer/designer, we would innovate in how we ask the question or how we make the kids feel (using a storyline), as that is under our control . This was my thinking process while thinking of an idea for this hackathon. A very obvious choice came to mind, A QUIZ. No surprises there. But the number of trivial quiz skills in the Alexa skills store is overwhelming. A very simple guess for the low ratings of such skills is that it does not innovate in the "ask question, expect answer" pattern. It just blindly follows it.I thought about many other skills, and all required the use of echo show to make it 'actually' fun to use or play. What I ended up with is  :A skill that would not ask:Only Geeky questions (boring for one and fun for the other)Only Math questions (enhance calculation skills)Only Game Of Thrones questions (make it fun for the start and boring after some time)...etc. (I think you got the point there)Moreover, I wanted to add a human touch to it so that the kids not only interact with Alexa but many others like Alexa. For example, if I am playing with an opponent (not a real one), I would not like Alexa to just tell me that this is your opponent, you will be competing with it. I would want the opponent to talk to me in some way so that I don't get bored with random opponent names. 
 Trying to provide a safer way of travelling. 
 On a campus of size as huge as TAMU, it is overwhelming to keep track of all the events happening around you. There are many organizations and initiatives going on and most of the time, students are oblivious about events that may be of interest to them. To overcome this challenge, we came up with an app that acts as an effective communication channel to keep students informed of all the events taking place on and around the campus. 
 Whenever in a party in hostel room, one phone or a laptop speaker is not enough, but we have so many android devices lying around these days, so why not make something that uses them all to do something cool, we searched for any app that does that but they either have too many requirements, or don't work.  
  
 We are busy. Everyone is. But we still want to do our hobbies like team sports or dining together. We call our friends, but everyone seems to be out of town or busy that day. The next day when they can make it, our boss asks us to do overtime work. Solution? Here comes Hangr. Good Friends in Seconds.  
 In a world of many groceries and farmer markets, a nice stalk of corn is probably waiting for that slab of butter that is just right. This is our audience. 
 In the last 3 years, Gamaification became a hot buzzword among companies and organizations. Gamification is the process of adding motivational elements within a system to increase user engagement based upon sound game theory and game mechanics. 
 We would like to create a way to record and share terminal sessions in a seamless way to promote community learning, tutorials, bug reproductions, and other use cases that would require a visible terminal session. 
 we were exploring other easier way to communicate with IOT devices in a home automation system.  we decided to use a chat bot to accomplish that. 
 We have an 8 month old daughter who just started to crawl so I installed a baby gate at the top of our stairs to prevent falls.  The problem is, making sure it's always properly closed can be difficult, especially for new parents like us.  You can forget to close it because you are in a hurry or not bother closing it because "I'll just be gone for a second".  And sometimes you think you closed it but it didn't latch properly.  I designed the Baby SmartGate to solve these issues and increase the safety of our home! 
 We take tyres for granted, perhaps too much, but if we learn that tyres are at least part and parcel the cause of an accident in which we are involved, we suddenly become very interested.  Both from the designer’s point of view and the one servicing them, it is an excellent idea to be aware. The mission is to reduce the problems faced by the drivers because of air loss in tyres. IoTyre is an Air Pressure Monitoring system which has a sensor that is installed in the vehicle near its tyre and monitors the tyre pressure. If a pressure loss occurs in one or more tyres, the system automatically shows this as a warning in the Iotyre Dashboard. Since an incorrect tyre pressure increases the braking distance, can impair cornering and can cause tyres to heat up, this automatic monitoring is intended to increase driving safety and prevent accidents. The driver also no longer needs to perform manual air pressure checks and is informed immediately about any tyre pressure problems.   
 We were thinking about a social app that can be built in 24 hours while We are having fun and learning new stuff. 
 When someone mentions you in any of your cloud apps, it is usually something that needs your attention quickly. None of the built in slack integrations explicitly supports putting mentions in a "priority inbox" slack channel that can get your attention quickly, such as your slackbot. This app solves that.How we built itUsing meteor and meteor packages we've created that are the basis for easily creating cloud integration apps, including support for filters, transforms, smart API endpoint pulling with last modified / since support, etc.List of packagescoffeescripthttpforce-sslhubaaa:accounts-slack # forked during hackathonaccounts-githubjsep:accounts-trellohubaaa:link-accounts # forked during hackathonsemantic:ui-csssemantic:ui-iconovcharik:alertifyjspracticalmeteor:loglevelpracticalmeteor:chaimanuel:viewmodelhubaaa:easy-meteor-settingshubaaa:easy-service-confighubaaa:json-pipeshubaaa:endpoint-pullerChallenges we ran intoNeeding to create an accounts-trello package (none existed in atmosphere that worked for us).Accomplishments that we're proud ofGetting this done in a less than weekend.What we've learnedThat meteor is perfect for quickly building oauth based cloud integration and automation apps.What's next for R U Talking 2 Me?We hope that this "hubapp" and additional future hubapps will become, with the help of the meteor community, the basis for a meteor based open source integration platform that will drastically cut down the development time of advanced cloud extension, integration and automation apps, as meteor did for web development. We'd like the platform to eliminate most of the boilerplate code required by integration and automation apps, such as code that deals with one-way-sync, two-way-sync, webhooks and pulling, identity mapping, fields changed, data filtering and mapping UIs, and much more.Built Withgithubmeteor.jsrutalking2meslacktrelloTry it outrutalking2me.meteor.comgithub.com      Submitted to    Meteor Global Distributed Hackathon     Created by  Juan Manuel VergesRonen BabayoffJuan Sepulveda 
  
  
 When I interview some Business companies that  uses SMS as their main ways of communicating their business endavour to their clients,customers etc. The response I got was that SMS could have been the best optionagainst Email Messages, if there is a way to Store, Warehouse  SMS Text Messages and Multi-Media Filesalready sent to their Customers devices,desktop applications for future retrival,Editing,Resending and for other purposes. Proffessor Mike Filler in my school who owns a Shopping Mall also Point out that SMS text Messages seems to be a use and throw away data and thus does not store data unlike Email while some Business specialist in my vicinity  who owns Butticks, Large Supermarkets, Agriculturist etc complainsthat their customer services recieve thousands of SMS text Messages in a day and that scrolling of the phones in search of SMS,sorting of the sms text Messages and Media Files in order to be able to respond back to their customers is time consuming andsometime absolutely impossible in a high traffic SMS reception environments.Dr & Mrs. Richard Moore who owns a construction Company where I did my Industrial Training as a IT. Scientist points out that itstrue that SMS is faster than Email in terms of real time messaging but they still need to have all their SMS Messages storedsomewhere in the could as a data where they can get it anytime anyday. He also points out that the SMS Messages should be senton 1-to-1 basis(ie Peer to Peer sms text messagings) with caging process that prevent for instance  prevents User C fromhaving access to conversation that exist between UserA and User B.My Dad points out that if an SMS app could be built to meet up all the functions above,it will make the app most suitable in Ticket System because since sms is a realtime messaging protocols and the app also provides one to one SMS Chatcommunications, it will make tracking of Messages,complains, issues etc on Tickets System very easy on each Users(Customers)Uniquely.What I  Learnt from Inspiration and Interview aboveI have seen reason why many companies are using Emails as means of communication with their customers and Clients as oppossedto using SMS which provides faster realtime messages. I also learnt that:A.) Every Company, School, Organisation needs their SMS Data/information to be stored somewhere in the cloud whereit can easily  be retrieved,edit, further process or even resend. 2.) I learnt there is a need for communication contuniuty especially in Tickets System where a Customer ask or sent a complain and the issue has to be tackled my sending a follow up messages in real time.3.) I also learnt that a company can have more than 1 million customers and there is a need to have to 1-to-1 message exchange which only SMS peer to peer technology can provide.4.) Many More ......What is on my mindSMS Chat Messenger is a messaging service built on sms technology Powered by Whispir.IoThe More I looked at Whispir.Io technology, the more I think of Whispir SMS not only as way of sending just text messagesand Media files to users devices but also as a database for data storage(Eg. For Schools, Companies, Transportaions, E-commerce etc.).Thinking of it as an SMS Chat messenger. I apply the ease of mobile messengers to Whispir SMS's protocol,thereby creating a universal communication platform available to anyone with an mobile number. (as opposed to Whatsapp/FB Messenger closed networks)What I builtAn app that allows Sending,Re-sending,Tracking and Sharing of sms text messages, Multi-Media files eg Photos via Peer to peer(1-to-1) sms ProtocolsEg. between one user and another, between a company and its clients etc.How to use the app1.) Create one time registration using your mobile contact and then login.2.) Sending and Sharing of SMS Text Messages and Media Files can be accomplished in 3 ways stated below:A.) Search the user you want to sms to from the search box using her mobile number or names. once the user is populated,click on the user and navigate to the users profile to start sending sms via 1-to-1 sms chat protocol.B.) You can also send SMS by clicking on Add People Button, select the User you are looking for and start sending smsC.) You can also send SMS from your friend list.To do this you can either search the user from the search box via mobile no, names etc or click on Add People to send friend request to that user, when the user acceppts your request, He or she automatically appears in Friend list and from there you can start sending SMS and Multi-Media Files.click on Load More Button if you need to load more friends..3.)SMS Alert Components keeps track of SMS Notifications that were sent to your devices. You can reply sms messages sentto you using this option.4.) SMS History: Keeps timely Tracks of all the SMS text Messages and Files you sent to your friends, customers etc. It provides with option to edit, resend and delete already sent SMS text Messages and Files.What happen when you sent a File(Eg. Photo) to Recipients via the app.The files get sent via the SMS Chat System immediately so that the recipient can see it if he or she is online. But because its an uploaded file not just a text message, whispir does not currentlyhave a way of sending the files directly to recipient devices. So what the app do is to send the files full link to the Recipient devices via WhispirSMS. The recipient can then download the file by typing the link on a browser or by clicking on adownload button withinthe app (SMS Chat Messaging System).Integration:The App can easily be integrated into social network, businesses, Transportations, Agriculture,Schools, E-commerce, Tickets System etc.ChallengesBuilding a Peer to Peer(1 to 1) SMS Chat Technology is very hard to accomplish. combining Files Sharing with text messagesis hard as well. Online and offline presence of each user is also hard to accomplishAbout Whispir TechnologyI have tested both Whispir Voice, Email and SMS API and found out they are easy to integrate and awesome.Their Engineers are professionals who knows their job.Built Withwhispir-smsTry it outfredcare.com      Submitted to    Whispir: Make Your App Talk    Created by  deleted deleted

 Cryptocurrency brings the promise of "being your own bank". However, the average user is in no way prepared to handle the responsibility that comes with that. Millions of coins have been lost or hacked due to poor private key management. The best solution we have for the average user is to "write your seed phrase on a piece of paper and store it in a bank deposit box." What happened to being your own bank??

 On the highway from Maharashtra to Gujarat, I met a lot of Artisans selling their clay pots and various other crafts on the Roadside of the National highway.The quality of their goods were very high and they were beautifully made but astonishingly they were selling at negligible rates! The reason is - they have the skill but not the means to showcase it well enough.India has a very diverse and unique handicrafts culture that is slowly fading away due to 2 reasonsLack of discoverability for artisans (to sell their products)Lack of consumer awareness (People just don't know about the beauty these artisans create!)We aim to solve this issue through our 2 sided marketplace and artisan awareness app - Artisell.Note: You may argue that there are a ton of eCommerce players trying to tap into the Rural Artisan community and sell their products online. But all of the apps (Flipkart, Myntra, Snapdeal, Limeroad) have horrible experience and expect that you are an expert in English, and the flow of mobile apps and various methodologies. Just go to Google Play and see the screenshots for any of the seller apps. They are the most difficult to use apps out there - as they ask 100s of things before you can really upload a product. Our apps primary aim is to make every single artisan be able to use the product from the get-go and requires little to no training in use of content systems. Also, the unique image and tag based search algorithms make it easy for buyers to search for products without having to know any unique SKUs. 
 If you use social media, you should know about the 10-year challenge, where people compare profile pictures from 10 years ago and now. All these data, YOUR DATA, could be mined to train facial recognition algorithms on age progression and age recognition. Think of the mass data extraction of over 70 million US Facebook users during the Cambridge Analytica scandal. This is a major concern of data privacy. 
 Well I was inspired to make this because of the contest and because of my need to Gamify everything.How it worksThe Game works by having you take a picture of yourself but it prompts you to make a face that corresponds with a random prompt. You then send that photo to your friends and they must guess what face you made and then send a selfie back.Challenges I ran intoGetting images to store on parse and then downloading them.Deleting images off of parse after they have been viewed.User Registration and finding friends.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofI'm pretty happy with all of it.What I learnedGamify Everything!What's next for WhatSnap?Android store? restyling, and using fragments instead of activities for everything.Ideally i want to write a server side version using twilio which allows people to text a number, get a prompt, send a picture through mms and do it that way as well.Built Withandroidandroid-studioparse      Submitted to    Reinvent the Selfie | Summer JamWinner                Digital Ocean Credits - $100                  Created by  Gene ChorbaI'm a Hackathon Pro and Head of Developer Relations at Riot Games

 Pat-a-cat was inspired when Aidon Lebar said "all i want to do is pet cats" and from there started a story of heroism as David Lougheed made it happen. In the corners of McHacks you could witness the cats being drawn, meows being recorded, and code being coded.  
 150 million people worldwide use Airbnb when searching for travel accommodations. How many of those people automatically check Airbnb as their default without ever comparing hotels nearby? While many people assume Airbnb has the lowest accommodation prices, in many places hotels are actually cheaper and/or provide a better experience than renting an Airbnb. We're deal hunters at our core and we wanted to make travel planning easy by enabling multiple sources of travel data in one place to get the best deals and experiences with the least amount of effort while planning the perfect dream vacation or that recurring work related trip. Enter Air Compare - the one stop shop travel planning Chrome extension that allows users to:• Compare hotels near the Airbnb listing they're considering • Get average car rental prices based on when you’re renting a car• Get estimated ride sharing (Lyft) prices to their destinationsWe wanted to provide users with the best accommodation deals but more importantly, we also wanted to solve the "last mile problem" (getting people from a transportation hub to their final destination) as it relates to travel. Often transportation costs end up adding up significantly and it’s difficult when planning a trip to estimate those costs ahead of time. We wanted to bring transparency to this area so there’s no hidden surprises when it comes time to travel, only #unforgettableexperiences. 
  
 We decided to explore the problem areas within Diagnostic Imaging. Currently, the daily error rate in the interpretation of CT scans is 3-5%. In addition, there are many communication gaps between radiology technicians and doctors. It can take days, even weeks for surgeons to contact radiologists. We want to expedite this process and improve the accuracy of patient diagnosis. 
 When conversing in group chats with other students, I noticed that many people often posted homework problems that they needed help with. However, often times their questions went unanswered, or the answers they got were unhelpful. That lead me to the idea of a more "conversational" academic assistance service - a platform on which students can easily ask bite-sized questions and instantaneously receive answers.I was inspired by HackHands (acquired by Pluralsight in 2015) and CodeMentor (which has raised $3.4M to date), both services that introduced this model to the programming community. I thought that the same model could be applied to other subjects, and so I created Aristotl.Note that while the web app is primarily targeted towards students for now, it could very easily be converted to instead be a platform for technical support, or for job training questions, etc. The sky's the limit!  
 In most cases, during disasters or emergencies be it a fire, a robbery, a mother in labor, blood deficiency, floods, etc, it's a matter of life or death and the people affected count on others for their own survival and getting assistance to them is always a race against time. We believe that even with the preparedness of other organizations such as the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) when a crisis hits, response time is dependent on how fast and to whom the news reach and that's why we created the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT). 
 Earlier I had a graph database, where I stored URL properties on nodes. I would like to get textual information from those URLs, I would like to do some web scraping, but without leaving the Cypher word. So, I have found out that web scraping procedures in Neo4j can be used to work on existing properties, and they can be used to produce output in a format where you can run further cypher commands on it. Let's see an example: You have product nodes with product names. You can use the product names to generate Ebay search URLs, and you can grab the process from that html page, and you can create new nodes in your Neo4j database, connecting the product nodes to some Ebay listing pages, and you can write the price property into your graph. But there are unlimited possibilities. These procedures can be used for preprocessing you your NLP pipelines as well.  
 As musicians, we can empathize with the struggles of new teachers and students as they hastily switch between jotting down melodies and sounding them out on a piano. As software developers, we also recognize the powers of technology to automate tedious and repetitive tasks. To bridge those two lives together, we came up with Capriccio. OMR - What Is It?Many of you may be familiar with optical character recognition (OCR), and the many companies that compete to do it the very best. Optical music recognition (OMR) is very similar, but far less studied and with equally fascinating applications. The world of OMR is dominated by professors and post-graduate students, but by combining Kotlin, OpenCV, and a dash of ingenuity we were able to make it happen in just one weekend. How Capriccio Works(1) Sheet MusicCapriccio starts at the mobile level, where a user can either take a photo of their handwritten music directly from the app, or import it from their gallery. (2) OpenCVTaking the image, we use OpenCV to perform feature detection and clustering. We then progressively generate a MIDI file by determining the location of key musical objects and assigning them pitches. (3) MIDIFinally, we pipe our fully created MIDI file back to Android, where you can play it right in the app. The total process takes between 5-10 seconds. Challenges we ran intoOn the mobile end, we wanted to make the application target Android 10. This meant carefully navigating various privacy demands that were both scarcely documented, and completely new to our team's developers. Meanwhile on the back end, it was tough performing feature detection and filtering out noise with OpenCV. Accomplishments that we're proud ofDespite the barriers we faced, our team is proud to have created an end-to-end application with so little time. We are also proud to have had such attention to detail, even going as far as to implement complicated animations just to open a dialog in Android. What's next for CapriccioTry out Magenta!Magenta is an open source Python library that explores the role of machine learning in the process of creating art and music. It would be amazing to integrate Magenta into Capriccio, either to extend music by matching our inputs against a database, or to generate chord progressions to enhance a simple melody.
